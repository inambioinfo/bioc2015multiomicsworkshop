	abstract = {{BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 are tumor suppressor genes, familial mutations in which account for approximately 5\% of breast cancer cases in the {USA} annually. Germ line mutations in {BRCA}1 that truncate or inactivate the protein lead to a cumulative risk of breast cancer, by age 70, of up to 80\%, whereas the risk of ovarian cancer is 30-40\%. For germ line {BRCA}2 mutations, the breast cancer cumulative risk approaches 50\%, whereas for ovarian cancers, it is between 10 and 15\%. Both {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 are involved in maintaining genome integrity at least in part by engaging in {DNA} repair, cell cycle checkpoint control and even the regulation of key mitotic or cell division steps. Unsurprisingly, the complete loss of function of either protein leads to a dramatic increase in genomic instability. How they function in maintaining genome integrity after the onset of {DNA} damage will be the focus of this review.},

It regulates protein secretion, for example translationally controlled tumor protein ({TCTP}), which is implicated in tumor reversion. In keeping with the latter, we show herein that {TSAP}6 is a glycosylated protein present in the trans-Golgi network, endosomal–vesicular compartment and cytoplasmic membrane. To further investigate the physiological function of {TSAP}6, we have generated {TSAP}6-deficient mice. These mice exhibit microcytic anemia with abnormal reticulocyte maturation and deficient transferrin receptor downregulation, a process known to be dependent on exosomal secretion. Moreover, we provide direct evidence that exosome production is severely compromised in {TSAP}6-null cells. Finally, we show that the {DNA} damage-induced p53-dependent nonclassical exosomal secretory pathway is abrogated in {TSAP}6-null cells. Given the fact that exosomes are used as cell-free vaccines against cancer and that they could be involved in the biogenesis and spread of human immunodeficiency virus, it is important to understand their regulation. The results presented here provide the first genetic demonstration that exosome formation is a tightly controlled biological process dependent of {TSAP}6.},

To better understand {GIPC}1 function, we suppressed its expression in human breast and colorectal cancer cell lines and human mammary epithelial cells ({HMECs}) and assayed both gene expression and cellular phenotype.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Previously, we found that gene expression in histologically normal breast epithelium ({NlEpi}) from women at high breast cancer risk can resemble gene expression in {NlEpi} from cancer-containing breasts. Therefore, we hypothesized that gene expression characteristic of a cancer subtype might be seen in {NlEpi} of breasts containing that subtype.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We examined gene expression in 46 cases of microdissected {NlEpi} from untreated women undergoing breast cancer surgery. From 30 age-matched cases [15 estrogen receptor ({ER})+, 15 {ER}-] we used Affymetryix U133A arrays. From 16 independent cases (9 {ER}+, 7 {ER}-), we validated selected genes using quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}). We then compared gene expression between {NlEpi} and invasive breast cancer using four publicly available data sets.
{RESULTS}: We identified 198 genes that are differentially expressed between {NlEpi} from breasts with {ER}+ ({NlEpiER}+) compared with {ER}- cancers ({NlEpiER}-). These include genes characteristic of {ER}+ and {ER}- cancers (e.g., {ESR}1, {GATA}3, and {CX}3CL1, {FABP}7). {qPCR} validated the microarray results in both the 30 original cases and the 16 independent cases. Gene expression in {NlEpiER}+ and {NlEpiER}- resembled gene expression in {ER}+ and {ER}- cancers, respectively: 25\% to 53\% of the genes or probes examined in four external data sets overlapped between {NlEpi} and the corresponding cancer subtype.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Gene expression differs in {NlEpi} of breasts containing {ER}+ compared with {ER}- breast cancers. These differences echo differences in {ER}+ and {ER}- invasive cancers. {NlEpi} gene expression may help elucidate subtype-specific risk signatures, identify early genomic events in cancer development, and locate targets for prevention and therapy.},

However, how ubiquitous expression of housekeeping genes is achieved has been less clear. In particular, it is unknown whether ubiquitously active enhancers exist and how developmental and housekeeping gene regulation is separated. An attractive hypothesis is that different core promoters might exhibit an intrinsic specificity to certain enhancers. This is conceivable, as various core promoter sequence elements are differentially distributed between genes of different functions, including elements that are predominantly found at either developmentally regulated or at housekeeping genes. Here we show that thousands of enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster S2 and ovarian somatic cells ({OSCs}) exhibit a marked specificity to one of two core promoters--one derived from a ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein gene and another from a developmentally regulated transcription factor--and confirm the existence of these two classes for five additional core promoters from genes with diverse functions. Housekeeping enhancers are active across the two cell types, while developmental enhancers exhibit strong cell-type specificity. Both enhancer classes differ in their genomic distribution, the functions of neighbouring genes, and the core promoter elements of these neighbouring genes. In addition, we identify two transcription factors--Dref and Trl--that bind and activate housekeeping versus developmental enhancers, respectively. Our results provide evidence for a sequence-encoded enhancer-core-promoter specificity that separates developmental and housekeeping gene regulatory programs for thousands of enhancers and their target genes across the entire genome.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Optimizing treatment through microarray-based molecular subtyping is a promising method to address the problem of heterogeneity in breast cancer; however, current application is restricted to prediction of distant recurrence risk. This study investigated whether breast cancer molecular subtyping according to its global intrinsic biology could be used for treatment customization.


{METHODS}

Gene expression profiling was conducted on fresh frozen breast cancer tissue collected from 327 patients in conjunction with thoroughly documented clinical data. A method of molecular subtyping based on 783 probe-sets was established and validated. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate molecular subtypes with survival outcome and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. Heterogeneity of molecular subtypes within groups sharing the same distant recurrence risk predicted by genes of the Oncotype and {MammaPrint} predictors was studied.


{RESULTS}

We identified six molecular subtypes of breast cancer demonstrating distinctive molecular and clinical characteristics. These six subtypes showed similarities and significant differences from the Perou-Sørlie intrinsic types. Subtype I breast cancer was in concordance with chemosensitive basal-like intrinsic type. Adjuvant chemotherapy of lower intensity with {CMF} yielded survival outcome similar to those of {CAF} in this subtype. Subtype {IV} breast cancer was positive for {ER} with a full-range expression of {HER}2, responding poorly to {CMF}; however, this subtype showed excellent survival when treated with {CAF}. Reduced expression of a gene associated with methotrexate sensitivity in subtype {IV} was the likely reason for poor response to methotrexate. All subtype V breast cancer was positive for {ER} and had excellent long-term survival with hormonal therapy alone following surgery and/or radiation therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide any survival benefit in early stages of subtype V patients. Subtype V was consistent with a unique subset of luminal A intrinsic type. When molecular subtypes were correlated with recurrence risk predicted by genes of Oncotype and {MammaPrint} predictors, a significant degree of heterogeneity within the same risk group was noted. This heterogeneity was distributed over several subtypes, suggesting that patients in the same risk groups require different treatment approaches.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our results indicate that the molecular subtypes established in this study can be utilized for customization of breast cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: A gene expression signature indicative of activated wound responses is common to more than 90\% of non-neoplastic tissues adjacent to breast cancer, but these tissues also exhibit substantial heterogeneity. We hypothesized that gene expression subtypes of breast cancer microenvironment can be defined and that these microenvironment subtypes have clinical relevance.
{METHODS}: Gene expression was evaluated in 72 patient-derived breast tissue samples adjacent to invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Unsupervised clustering identified two distinct gene expression subgroups that differed in expression of genes involved in activation of fibrosis, cellular movement, cell adhesion and cell-cell contact. We evaluated the prognostic relevance of extratumoral subtype (comparing the Active group, defined by high expression of fibrosis and cellular movement genes, to the Inactive group, defined by high expression of claudins and other cellular adhesion and cell-cell contact genes) using clinical data. To establish the biological characteristics of these subtypes, gene expression profiles were compared against published and novel tumor and tumor stroma-derived signatures (Twist-related protein 1 ({TWIST}1) overexpression, transforming growth factor beta ({TGF}-β)-induced fibroblast activation, breast fibrosis, claudin-low tumor subtype and estrogen response). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tissues representing each microenvironment subtype were performed to evaluate protein expression and compositional differences between microenvironment subtypes.
{RESULTS}: Extratumoral Active versus Inactive subtypes were not significantly associated with overall survival among all patients (hazard ratio ({HR}) = 1.4, 95\% {CI} 0.6 to 2.8, P = 0.337), but there was a strong association with overall survival among estrogen receptor ({ER}) positive patients ({HR} = 2.5, 95\% {CI} 0.9 to 6.7, P = 0.062) and hormone-treated patients ({HR} = 2.6, 95\% {CI} 1.0 to 7.0, P = 0.045). The Active subtype of breast microenvironment is correlated with {TWIST}-overexpression signatures and shares features of claudin-low breast cancers. The Active subtype was also associated with expression of {TGF}-β induced fibroblast activation signatures, but there was no significant association between Active/Inactive microenvironment and desmoid type fibrosis or estrogen response gene expression signatures. Consistent with the {RNA} expression profiles, Active cancer-adjacent tissues exhibited higher density of {TWIST} nuclear staining, predominantly in epithelium, and no evidence of increased fibrosis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results document the presence of two distinct subtypes of microenvironment, with Active versus Inactive cancer-adjacent extratumoral microenvironment influencing the aggressiveness and outcome of {ER}-positive human breast cancers.},

Paradoxically, in spite of the apparent functional role that might be attributed to such gene sets, signatures do not seem to be reproducible across experiments. Given the close relationship between function and protein interaction, network properties can be used to study to what extent signatures are composed of genes whose resulting proteins show a considerable level of interaction (and consequently a putative common functional role).We have analysed 618 signatures and 507 modules of co-expression in cancer looking for significant values of four main protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) network parameters: connection degree, cluster coefficient, betweenness and number of components. A total of 3904 gene ontology ({GO}) modules, 146 {KEGG} pathways, and 263 Biocarta pathways have been used as functional modules of reference.Co-expression modules found in microarray experiments display a high level of connectivity, similar to the one shown by conventional modules based on functional definitions ({GO}, {KEGG} and Biocarta). A general observation for all the classes studied is that the networks formed by the modules improve their topological parameters when an external protein is allowed to be introduced within the paths (up to the 70\% of {GO} modules show network parameters beyond the random expectation). This fact suggests that functional definitions are incomplete and some genes might still be missing. Conversely, signatures are clearly not capturing the altered functions in the corresponding studies. This is probably because the way in which the genes have been selected in the signatures is too conservative. These results suggest that gene selection methods which take into account relationships among genes should be superior to methods that assume independence among genes outside their functional contexts.},

	abstract = {Multiple myeloma ({MM}) is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by very complex cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations. In newly diagnosed symptomatic patients, the modal chromosome number is usually either hyperdiploid with multiple trisomies or hypodiploid with one of several types of immunoglobulin heavy chain (Ig) translocations. The chromosome ploidy status and Ig rearrangements are two genetic criteria that are used to help stratify patients into prognostic groups based on the findings of conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization ({FISH}). In general, the hypodiploid group with t(4;14)(p16;q32) or t(14;16)(q32;q23) is considered a high-risk group, while the hyperdiploid patients with t(11;14)(q13;q32) are considered a better prognostic group. As the disease progresses, it becomes more proliferative and develops a number of secondary chromosome aberrations. These secondary aberrations commonly involve {MYC} rearrangements, del(13q), del(17p), and the deletion of 1p and/or amplification of 1q. Of the secondary aberrations, del(17p) is consistently associated with poor prognosis. All of these cytogenetic aberrations and many additional ones are now identified by means of high resolution molecular profiling. Gene expression profiling ({GEP}), array comparative genomic hybridization ({aCGH}), and single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) arrays have been able to identify novel genetic aberration patterns that have previously gone unrecognized. With the integration of data from these profiling techniques, new subclassifications of {MM} have been proposed which define distinct molecular genetic subgroups. In this review, the findings from conventional cytogenetics, interphase {FISH}, {GEP}, {aCGH}, and {SNP} profiles are described to provide the conceptual framework for defining the emerging molecular genetic subgroups with prognostic significance.},

However, standard approaches for mapping the resulting sequencing reads generally ignore alternative sources of expression other than the host cell and are little equipped to address the problems arising from redundancies and gaps among sequenced microbe and virus genomes. We show that screening of sequencing reads for contaminations and infections can be performed easily using {ContextMap}, our recently developed mapping software. Based on mapping–derived statistics, mapping confidence, similarities and misidentifications (e.g. due to missing genome sequences) of species/strains can be assessed. Performance of our approach is evaluated on three real–life sequencing data sets and compared to state–of–the–art metagenomics tools. In particular, {ContextMap} vastly outperformed {GASiC} and {GRAMMy} in terms of runtime. In contrast to {MEGAN}4, it was capable of providing individual read mappings to species and resolving non–unique mappings, thus allowing the identification of misalignments caused by sequence similarities between genomes and missing genome sequences. Our study illustrates the importance and potentials of routinely mining {RNA}–seq experiments for infections or contaminations by microbes and viruses. By using {ContextMap}, gene expression of infecting agents can be analyzed and novel insights in infection processes and tumorigenesis can be obtained.},

Here, we discuss how these tumour–stromal interactions affect tumour cell signalling, survival, proliferation and drug sensitivity. Particular emphasis is placed on the ability of stromal cells to confer — to tumour cells — resistance or sensitization to different classes of therapeutics, depending on the specific microenvironmental context. The mechanistic understanding of these microenvironmental interactions can influence the evaluation and selection of candidate agents for various cancers, in both the primary site as well as the metastatic setting. Progress in in vitro screening platforms as well as orthotopic and 'orthometastatic' xenograft mouse models has enabled comprehensive characterization of the impact of the tumour microenvironment on therapeutic efficacy. These recent advances can hopefully bridge the gap between preclinical studies and clinical trials of anticancer agents.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Breast cancer subtypes identified in genomic studies have different underlying genetic defects. Mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 occur more frequently in estrogen receptor ({ER}) negative, basal-like and {HER}2-amplified tumors than in luminal, {ER} positive tumors. Thus, because p53 mutation status is tightly linked to other characteristics of prognostic importance, it is difficult to identify p53's independent prognostic effects. The relation between p53 status and subtype can be better studied by combining data from primary tumors with data from isogenic cell line pairs (with and without p53 function). {METHODS} The p53-dependent gene expression signatures of four cell lines ({MCF}-7, {ZR}-75-1, and two immortalized human mammary epithelial cell lines) were identified by comparing p53-{RNAi} transduced cell lines to their parent cell lines. Cell lines were treated with vehicle only or doxorubicin to identify p53 responses in both non-induced and induced states. The cell line signatures were compared with p53-mutation associated genes in breast tumors. {RESULTS} Each cell line displayed distinct patterns of p53-dependent gene expression, but cell type specific (basal vs. luminal) commonalities were evident. Further, a common gene expression signature associated with p53 loss across all four cell lines was identified. This signature showed overlap with the signature of p53 loss/mutation status in primary breast tumors. Moreover, the common cell-line tumor signature excluded genes that were breast cancer subtype-associated, but not downstream of p53. To validate the biological relevance of the common signature, we demonstrated that this gene set predicted relapse-free, disease-specific, and overall survival in independent test data. {CONCLUSION} In the presence of breast cancer heterogeneity, experimental and biologically-based methods for assessing gene expression in relation to p53 status provide prognostic and biologically-relevant gene lists. Our biologically-based refinements excluded genes that were associated with subtype but not downstream of p53 signaling, and identified a signature for p53 loss that is shared across breast cancer subtypes.},

	abstract = {{TPD}52 and {ERBB}2 co-expression has been persistently reported in human breast cancer and animal models of this disease, but the significance of this is unknown. We identified significant positive associations between relative {TPD}52 and {ERBB}2 transcript levels in human diagnostic breast cancer samples, and maximal {TPD}52 expression in the hormone receptor ({HR})- and {ERBB}2-positive sub-group. High-level {TPD}52 expression was associated with significantly reduced metastasis-free survival, within the overall cohort (log rank test, P = 8.6 × 10(-4) , n = 375) where this was an independent predictor of metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.69, 95\% confidence interval 1.59-4.54, P = 2.2 × 10(-4) , n = 359), and the {HR}- and {ERBB}2-positive sub-group (log rank test, P = 0.035, n = 47). Transient {TPD}52 knock-down in the {ERBB}2-amplified breast cancer cell lines {SK}-{BR}-3 and {BT}-474 produced significant apoptosis, both singly and in combination with transient {ERBB}2 knock-down. Unlike {ERBB}2 knock-down, transient {TPD}52 knock-down produced no reduction in {pAKT} levels in {SK}-{BR}-3 or {BT}-474 cells. We then derived multiple {SK}-{BR}-3 cell lines in which {TPD}52 levels were stably reduced, and measured significant inverse correlations between {pERBB}2 and {TPD}52 levels in viable {TPD}52-depleted and control cell lines, all of which showed similar proliferative capacities. Our results therefore identify {TPD}52 as a survival factor in {ERBB}2-amplified breast cancer cells, and suggest complementary cellular functions for {TPD}52 and {ERBB}2. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Notch signaling deregulation is linked to the onset of several tumors including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-{ALL}). Deregulated {microRNA} ({miRNA}) expression is also associated with several cancers, including leukemias. However, the transcriptional regulators of {miRNAs}, as well as the relationships between Notch signaling and {miRNA} deregulation, are poorly understood. To identify {miRNAs} regulated by Notch pathway, we performed microarray-based {miRNA} profiling of several Notch-expressing T-{ALL} models. Among seven {miRNAs}, consistently regulated by overexpressing or silencing Notch3, we focused our attention on {miR}-223, whose putative promoter analysis revealed a conserved {RBPjk} binding site, which was nested to an {NF}-{kB} consensus. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on the promoter region of {miR}-223 show that both Notch and {NF}-{kB} are novel coregulatory signals of {miR}-223 expression, being able to activate cooperatively the transcriptional activity of {miR}-223 promoter. Notably, the Notch-mediated activation of {miR}-223 represses the tumor suppressor {FBXW}7 in T-{ALL} cell lines. Moreover, we observed the inverse correlation of {miR}-223 and {FBXW}7 expression in a panel of T-{ALL} patient-derived xenografts. Finally, we show that {miR}-223 inhibition prevents T-{ALL} resistance to γ-secretase inhibitor ({GSI}) treatment, suggesting that {miR}-223 could be involved in {GSI} sensitivity and its inhibition may be exploited in target therapy protocols.},

Recently, many studies have used microarrays to measure gene expression levels across genetic mapping populations. These gene expression phenotypes have been used for genome-wide association analyses, an analysis referred to as expression {QTL} ({eQTL}) mapping. Here, {eQTL} analysis was performed in adipose tissue from 28 inbred strains of mice. We focused our analysis on "trans-{eQTL} bands", defined as instances in which the expression patterns of many genes were all associated to a common genetic locus. Genes comprising trans-{eQTL} bands were screened for enrichments in functional gene sets representing known biological pathways, and genes located at associated trans-{eQTL} band loci were considered candidate transcriptional modulators. We demonstrate that these patterns were enriched for previously characterized relationships between known upstream transcriptional regulators and their downstream target genes. Moreover, we used this strategy to identify both novel regulators and novel members of known pathways. Finally, based on a putative regulatory relationship identified in our analysis, we identified and validated a previously uncharacterized role for cyclin H in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. We believe that the specific molecular hypotheses generated in this study will reveal many additional pathway members and regulators, and that the analysis approaches described herein will be broadly applicable to other {eQTL} data sets.},

To unravel the genomic determinants of response to this therapy, we used whole-exome sequencing of non–small cell lung cancers treated with pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting programmed cell death-1 ({PD}-1). In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and {DNA} repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden. In one responder, neoantigen-specific {CD}8+ T cell responses paralleled tumor regression, suggesting that anti–{PD}-1 therapy enhances neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity. Our results suggest that the genomic landscape of lung cancers shapes response to anti–{PD}-1 therapy.
More mutations predict better efficacy
Despite the remarkable success of cancer immunotherapies, many patients do not respond to treatment. Rizvi et al. studied the tumors of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer undergoing immunotherapy. In two independent cohorts, treatment efficacy was associated with a higher number of mutations in the tumors. In one patient, a tumor-specific T cell response paralleled tumor regression.

Triple-negative tumors account for 15\% of all breast cancers and frequently harbor defects in {DNA} double-strand break repair through homologous recombination ({HR}), such as {BRCA}1 dysfunction. The {DNA}-repair defects characteristic of {BRCA}1-deficient cells confer sensitivity to poly({ADP}-ribose) polymerase 1 ({PARP}1) inhibition, which could be relevant to treatment of triple-negative tumors. To evaluate {PARP}1 inhibition in a realistic in vivo setting, we tested the {PARP} inhibitor {AZD}2281 in a genetically engineered mouse model ({GEMM}) for {BRCA}1-associated breast cancer. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with {AZD}2281 inhibited tumor growth without signs of toxicity, resulting in strongly increased survival. Long-term treatment with {AZD}2281 in this model did result in the development of drug resistance, caused by up-regulation of Abcb1a/b genes encoding P-glycoprotein efflux pumps. This resistance to {AZD}2281 could be reversed by coadministration of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor tariquidar. Combination of {AZD}2281 with cisplatin or carboplatin increased the recurrence-free and overall survival, suggesting that {AZD}2281 potentiates the effect of these {DNA}-damaging agents. Our results demonstrate in vivo efficacy of {AZD}2281 against {BRCA}1-deficient breast cancer and illustrate how {GEMMs} of cancer can be used for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutics and for testing ways to overcome or circumvent therapy resistance.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, is a major regulator of tumor development and aggressiveness. However, how cancer cells adapt to hypoxia and communicate with their surrounding microenvironment during tumor development remain important questions. Here, we show that secreted vesicles with exosome characteristics mediate hypoxia-dependent intercellular signaling of the highly malignant brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}). In vitro hypoxia experiments with glioma cells and studies with patient materials reveal the enrichment in exosomes of hypoxia-regulated {mRNAs} and proteins (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, {IL}-8, {PDGFs}, caveolin 1, and lysyl oxidase), several of which were associated with poor glioma patient prognosis. We show that exosomes derived from {GBM} cells grown at hypoxic compared with normoxic conditions are potent inducers of angiogenesis ex vivo and in vitro through phenotypic modulation of endothelial cells. Interestingly, endothelial cells were programmed by {GBM} cell-derived hypoxic exosomes to secrete several potent growth factors and cytokines and to stimulate pericyte {PI}3K/{AKT} signaling activation and migration. Moreover, exosomes derived from hypoxic compared with normoxic conditions showed increased autocrine, promigratory activation of {GBM} cells. These findings were correlated with significantly enhanced induction by hypoxic compared with normoxic exosomes of tumor vascularization, pericyte vessel coverage, {GBM} cell proliferation, as well as decreased tumor hypoxia in a mouse xenograft model. We conclude that the proteome and {mRNA} profiles of exosome vesicles closely reflect the oxygenation status of donor glioma cells and patient tumors, and that the exosomal pathway constitutes a potentially targetable driver of hypoxia-dependent intercellular signaling during tumor development.},

The papers in this issue of Biochemical Society Transactions review work in areas including {HIV} infection, kidney disease, hypoxia-mediated tumorigenesis and down-regulation of immune cell functions in acute myeloid leukaemia by tumour-derived exosomes. In all cases, microvesicles and exosomes have been demonstrated to be important factors leading to the pathophysiology of disease or indeed as therapeutic vehicles in possible new treatments. The aim was, having enhanced our molecular understanding of the contribution of microvesicles and exosomes to disease in vitro, to begin to apply this knowledge to in vivo models of disease.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the chemosensitivity of infiltrating lobular breast carcinoma ({ILC}) in comparison with infiltrating ductal carcinoma ({IDC}). Between 1987 and 1995, 457 patients with invasive T2{\textgreater}3 cm-T4 breast carcinomas were treated with primary chemotherapy ({CT}), surgery, radiation therapy. Clinical response, the possibility of breast preservation, pathological response and survival were evaluated according to the histological type. In order to evaluate the biological differences between {ILC} and {IDC} patients and their implication with regard to tumour chemosensitivity, additional immunohistochemical stainings (oestrogen receptor ({ER}), Bcl2, p53, c-{erbB}-2 and Ki67) were performed on 129 pretherapeutical specimens. 38 (8.3\%) {ILC} were diagnosed by core needle biopsy before {CT}. {ILC} was an independent predictor of a poor clinical response (P=0.02) and ineligibility for breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.03). Histological and biological factors predicting a poor response to {CT} (histological grade, {ER}, Ki67 and p53 status) were more frequent in {ILC} than in {IDC} patients. After a median follow-up of 98 months (range: 3-166), the low chemosensitivity of {ILC} did not result in a survival disadvantage. Our results demonstrate that {ILC} achieved a lower response to {CT} than {IDC} because of their immunohistochemical profile. Preoperative {CT} did not allow a high rate of conservative treatment for {ILC} and therefore the use of neoadjuvant {CT} for {ILC} patients should be questioned.},

It has been well known that tumor cells harness immune system through information exchanges that are largely attributed to soluble protein factors and intercellular junctions. In this review, we will discuss recent advance on tumor metabolism and immune metabolism, as well as provide examples of metabolic communications between tumor cells and immune system, which may represent a novel mechanism of conveying tumor-immune privilege.},

	abstract = {Breast milk is a complex liquid with immune-competent cells and soluble proteins that provide immunity to the infant and affect the maturation of the infant's immune system. Exosomes are nanovesicles (30-100 nm) with an endosome-derived limiting membrane secreted by a diverse range of cell types. Because exosomes carry immunorelevant structures, they are suggested to participate in directing the immune response. We hypothesized that human breast milk contain exosomes, which may be important for the development of the infant's immune system. We isolated vesicles from the human colostrum and mature breast milk by ultracentrifugations and/or immuno-isolation on paramagnetic beads. We found that the vesicles displayed a typical exosome-like size and morphology as analyzed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, they floated at a density between 1.10 and 1.18 g/ml in a sucrose gradient, corresponding to the known density of exosomes. In addition, {MHC} classes I and {II}, {CD}63, {CD}81, and {CD}86 were detected on the vesicles by flow cytometry. Western blot and mass spectrometry further confirmed the presence of several exosome-associated molecules. Functional analysis revealed that the vesicle preparation inhibited anti-{CD}3-induced {IL}-2 and {IFN}-gamma production from allogeneic and autologous {PBMC}. In addition, an increased number of Foxp3(+){CD}4(+){CD}25(+) T regulatory cells were observed in {PBMC} incubated with milk vesicle preparations.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Recent studies have investigated the contribution of copy number variants ({CNVs}) to disease susceptibility in a multitude of complex disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, and various neurodevelopmental disorders. Relatively few {CNV} studies, however, have been conducted on pharmacologic phenotypes even though these structural variants are likely to play an important role. We developed a genome-wide method to identify {CNVs} that contribute to heterogeneity in drug response, focusing on drugs that are widely used in anticancer treatment regimens.


{RESULTS}

We conducted a comprehensive genome-wide study of {CNVs} from population-scale array-based and sequencing-based surveys by analyzing their effect on cellular sensitivity to platinating agents and topoisomerase {II} inhibitors. We identified extensive {CNV} regions associated with cellular sensitivity to functionally diverse chemotherapeutics, supporting the hypothesis that variation in copy number contributes to variation in drug response. Interestingly, although single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) tag some of the {CNVs} associated with drug sensitivity, several of the most significant {CNV}-drug associations are independent of {SNPs}; consequently, they represent genetic variations that have not been previously interrogated by {SNP} studies of pharmacologic phenotypes.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our findings demonstrate that pharmacogenomic studies may greatly benefit from the study of {CNVs} as expression quantitative trait loci, thus contributing broadly to our understanding of the complex traits genetics of {CNVs}. We also extend our {PACdb} resource, a database that makes available to the scientific community relationships between genetic variation, gene expression, and sensitivity to various drugs in cell-based models.},

Emerging evidence suggests communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment occurs via exosomes. This study aimed to clarify whether hypoxia affects angiogenic function through exosomes secreted from leukemia cells. We used the human leukemia cell line K562 for exosome-generating cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ({HUVECs}) for exosome target cells. Exosomes derived from K562 cells cultured under normoxic (20\%) or hypoxic (1\%) conditions for 24 h were isolated and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis. These exosomes were then cocultured with {HUVECs} to evaluate angiogenic activity. The exosomes secreted from K562 cells in hypoxic conditions significantly enhanced tube formation by {HUVECs} compared with exosomes produced in normoxic conditions. Using a {TaqMan} low-density {miRNA} array, we found a subset of {miRNAs}, including {miR}-210, were significantly increased in exosomes secreted from hypoxic K562 cells. We demonstrated that cancer cells and their exosomes have altered {miRNA} profiles under hypoxic conditions. Although exosomes contain various molecular constituents, such as proteins and {mRNAs}, altered exosomal compartments under hypoxic conditions, including {miR}-210, affected the behavior of endothelial cells. Our results suggest that exosomal {miRNA} derived from cancer cells under hypoxic conditions may partly affect angiogenic activity in endothelial cells.},

Notably, the interplay via the exchange of exosomes between cancer cells and between cancer cells and the tumor stroma may promote the transfer of oncogenes (e.g. β-catenin, {CEA}, {HER}2, Melan-A/Mart-1 and {LMP}-1) and onco-{microRNAs} (e.g. let7, {miR}1, {miR}15, {miR}16 and {miR}375) from one cell to another, leading to the reprogramming of the recipient cells.

Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Relative risks associated with {IDC} or {ILC} and other important prognostic factors and adjusted for each other were computed using Cox proportional hazard regression. The proportion of grade I tumors was significantly higher in {ILC} (41\%) than in {IDC} (16\%). Conversely, the proportion of grade {III} tumors was only 18\% in {ILC} as against 41\% in {IDC} (p = 0.020). The 10-year survival of women with {IDC} was 69\%, compared to 84\% for {ILC} (p = 0.073). However, the 15 percentile point difference between overall survival of {IDC} and {ILC} was markedly reduced after adjustment for nodal status. The difference was eight percentile points for node-negative patients (p = 0.361) and five percentile points for node-positive patients (p = 0.464). Age at diagnosis, tumor size, pathologic stage, and lymph node status were independent prognostic indicators for 10-year survival. There was no prognostic difference between {IDC} and {ILC}. The result shows the importance of adjusting for other important clinicopathologic characteristics before comparing the overall survival of {IDC} and {ILC}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Intratumor heterogeneity may foster tumor evolution and adaptation and hinder personalized-medicine strategies that depend on results from single tumor-biopsy samples.
{METHODS}: To examine intratumor heterogeneity, we performed exome sequencing, chromosome aberration analysis, and ploidy profiling on multiple spatially separated samples obtained from primary renal carcinomas and associated metastatic sites. We characterized the consequences of intratumor heterogeneity using immunohistochemical analysis, mutation functional analysis, and profiling of messenger {RNA} expression.
{RESULTS}: Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed branched evolutionary tumor growth, with 63 to 69\% of all somatic mutations not detectable across every tumor region. Intratumor heterogeneity was observed for a mutation within an autoinhibitory domain of the mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) kinase, correlating with S6 and 4EBP phosphorylation in vivo and constitutive activation of {mTOR} kinase activity in vitro. Mutational intratumor heterogeneity was seen for multiple tumor-suppressor genes converging on loss of function; {SETD}2, {PTEN}, and {KDM}5C underwent multiple distinct and spatially separated inactivating mutations within a single tumor, suggesting convergent phenotypic evolution. Gene-expression signatures of good and poor prognosis were detected in different regions of the same tumor. Allelic composition and ploidy profiling analysis revealed extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with 26 of 30 tumor samples from four tumors harboring divergent allelic-imbalance profiles and with ploidy heterogeneity in two of four tumors.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Intratumor heterogeneity can lead to underestimation of the tumor genomics landscape portrayed from single tumor-biopsy samples and may present major challenges to personalized-medicine and biomarker development. Intratumor heterogeneity, associated with heterogeneous protein function, may foster tumor adaptation and therapeutic failure through Darwinian selection.

For in vitro and in vivo experiments we used 1833-bone metastatic clone, derived from human-{MDA}-{MB}231 cells. In osteolytic bone metastases and in metastatic cells, Met was expressed in nuclei and at plasma membrane, and abnormally co-localised at nuclear level with beta-catenin and the tyrosine phosphorylated c-Src kinase. Thus, in 1833 cells nuclear-Met {COOH}-terminal fragment and beta-catenin-{TCF} were constitutively activated, possibly by receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. The activity of the gene reporter {TOPFLASH} (containing multiple {TCF}/{LEF}-consensus sites) was measured, as index of beta-catenin functionality. In 1833 cells, human and mouse {HGF} increased Met and beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and expression in nuclear and perinuclear compartments, beta-catenin nuclear translocation via Kank and {TOPFLASH} transactivation. Human {HGF} was autocrine/intracrine in bone metastasis, and mouse {HGF} originating from the adjacent host-bone marrow, was found inside the metastatic nuclei. Parental {MDA}-{MB}231 cell nuclei did not show functional beta-catenin, for {TCF}-transactivating activity, and the regulation by {HGF}. Our study highlighted the importance of the metastasis-stroma interaction in human-breast cancer metastatisation and first identified the {HGF}/nuclear Met/phospho-c-Src/beta-catenin-{TCF}/Wnt pathway as a potential-therapeutic target to delay establishment/progression of bone metastases by affecting the aggressive phenotype.},

The process of metastasis is highly selective, and the metastatic lesion represents the end point of many destructive events that only a few cells can survive. Neoplasms, which are predominantly heterogeneous, contain a variety of subpopulations of cells with differing metastatic potential. Furthermore, metastatic cell variants have been shown to preexist in murine neoplasms of old and recent origin. The possible existence of highly metastatic variant cells within a primary tumor suggests that we no longer should consider a neoplasm to be a uniform entity. Efforts to design effective therapeutic agents and procedures against malignant tumors should be directed toward the few but fatal metastatic subpopulations of cells.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Cancer is a heterogeneous disease resulting from the accumulation of genetic defects that negatively impact control of cell division, motility, adhesion and apoptosis. Deregulation in signaling along the {EgfR}-{MAPK} pathway is common in breast cancer, though the manner in which deregulation occurs varies between both individuals and cancer subtypes. {RESULTS} We were interested in identifying subnetworks within the {EgfR}-{MAPK} pathway that are similarly deregulated across subsets of breast cancers. To that end, we mapped genomic, transcriptional and proteomic profiles for 30 breast cancer cell lines onto a curated Pathway Logic symbolic systems model of {EgfR}-{MAPK} signaling. This model was composed of 539 molecular states and 396 rules governing signaling between active states. We analyzed these models and identified several subtype-specific subnetworks, including one that suggested Pak1 is particularly important in regulating the {MAPK} cascade when it is over-expressed. We hypothesized that Pak1 over-expressing cell lines would have increased sensitivity to Mek inhibitors. We tested this experimentally by measuring quantitative responses of 20 breast cancer cell lines to three Mek inhibitors. We found that Pak1 over-expressing luminal breast cancer cell lines are significantly more sensitive to Mek inhibition compared to those that express Pak1 at low levels. This indicates that Pak1 over-expression may be a useful clinical marker to identify patient populations that may be sensitive to Mek inhibitors. {CONCLUSIONS} All together, our results support the utility of symbolic system biology models for identification of therapeutic approaches that will be effective against breast cancer subsets.},

We found that overexpression of {miR}-203 significantly decreased cell proliferation and survival, and induced cell apoptosis in the p53-mutated colon cancer cells. Importantly, {miR}-203 overexpression increased the cytotoxic role of paclitaxel in the p53-mutated colon cancer cells, but not in the p53 wild-type cells. We further demonstrated that the tumor suppressive role of {miR}-203 was mediated by negatively regulating Akt2 protein expression through {mRNA} degradation. The inhibition of Akt2 activity downregulated the protein expression of its downstream molecules involved in chemoresistance, such as {MTDH} and {HSP}90 genes. Also, overexpression of {miR}-203 decreased anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-{xL} expression and increased apoptotic proteins Bax and active caspase-3 levels. Our study is the first to identify the tumor suppressive role of overexpressed {miR}-203, describe its associated signaling pathways, and highlight the role of {miR}-203 in chemoresistance.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Currently, a number of bioinformatics methods are available to generate appropriate lists of genes from a microarray experiment. While these lists represent an accurate primary analysis of the data, fewer options exist to contextualise those lists. The development and validation of such methods is crucial to the wider application of microarray technology in the clinical setting. Two key challenges in clinical bioinformatics involve appropriate statistical modelling of dynamic transcriptomic changes, and extraction of clinically relevant meaning from very large datasets.{RESULTS}:Here, we apply an approach to gene set enrichment analysis that allows for detection of bi-directional enrichment within a gene set. Furthermore, we apply canonical correlation analysis and Fisher's exact test, using plasma marker data with known clinical relevance to aid identification of the most important gene and pathway changes in our transcriptomic dataset. After a 28-day dietary intervention with high-{CLA} beef, a range of plasma markers indicated a marked improvement in the metabolic health of genetically obese mice. Tissue transcriptomic profiles indicated that the effects were most dramatic in liver (1270 genes significantly changed; p {\textless} 0.05), followed by muscle (601 genes) and adipose (16 genes). Results from modified {GSEA} showed that the high-{CLA} beef diet affected diverse biological processes across the three tissues, and that the majority of pathway changes reached significance only with the bi-directional test. Combining the liver tissue microarray results with plasma marker data revealed 110 {CLA}-sensitive genes showing strong canonical correlation with one or more plasma markers of metabolic health, and 9 significantly overrepresented pathways among this set; each of these pathways was also significantly changed by the high-{CLA} diet. Closer inspection of two of these pathways - selenoamino acid metabolism and steroid biosynthesis - illustrated clear diet-sensitive changes in constituent genes, as well as strong correlations between gene expression and plasma markers of metabolic syndrome independent of the dietary effect.{CONCLUSION}:Bi-directional gene set enrichment analysis more accurately reflects dynamic regulatory behaviour in biochemical pathways, and as such highlighted biologically relevant changes that were not detected using a traditional approach. In such cases where transcriptomic response to treatment is exceptionally large, canonical correlation analysis in conjunction with Fisher's exact test highlights the subset of pathways showing strongest correlation with the clinical markers of interest. In this case, we have identified selenoamino acid metabolism and steroid biosynthesis as key pathways mediating the observed relationship between metabolic health and high-{CLA} beef. These results indicate that this type of analysis has the potential to generate novel transcriptome-based biomarkers of disease.},

Th in vitro growth pattern morphological and cytogenetic characteristics of these lines maintained continuously for over 2 years are described. The cultures contain a population of mixed cell types that grow in suspension. Between 5 and 10\% of the cells have surface immunoglobulins M and D. B-cell alloantigens are also detectable. While the cultures are predominantly lymphoid, some of the large cells, by light and electron microscopy, resemble the Reed-Sternberg and Hodgkin's cells of the original biopsies. Although the cells maintain the human diploid karyotype, they are heterotransplantable in nude mice. After 14 months of culture, chromosome rearrangement and losses, commonly seen in leukemic bone marrow, occurred. Close to 100\% of the cells are Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen positive, but they lack Epstein-Barr viral ({EBV}) capsid antigen and {EBV}-induced early antigen. Nucleic acid hybridization tests indicated that there were no more than two {EBV} genome equivalents per cell. Tests with {HD} sera free of anti-{EBV} were negative. Electron microscope examination of the cells revealed the presence of intracellular as well as extracellular rare pleomorphic particles ranging from 400 to 1200 A. The nature of these particles, which increased in number after the cultures were treated with halogenated pyrimidines but not with dimethyl sulfoxide, remains questionable. The cultures derived from the mouse-passaged {HD} cells, however, had reverse transcriptase activity and readily identifiable type C particles which were probably of murine origin. These cultures have some unique features that make them useful in studying the perplexing pathological entity of {HD}.},

Here we present an integrated analysis of 1,975 published microarrays spanning 22 tumor types. We describe expression profiles in different tumors in terms of the behavior of modules, sets of genes that act in concert to carry out a specific function. Using a simple unified analysis, we extract modules and characterize gene-expression profiles in tumors as a combination of activated and deactivated modules. Activation of some modules is specific to particular types of tumor; for example, a growth-inhibitory module is specifically repressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and may underlie the deregulated proliferation in these cancers. Other modules are shared across a diverse set of clinical conditions, suggestive of common tumor progression mechanisms. For example, the bone osteoblastic module spans a variety of tumor types and includes both secreted growth factors and their receptors. Our findings suggest that there is a single mechanism for both primary tumor proliferation and metastasis to bone. Our analysis presents multiple research directions for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic studies.},

Although dissemination is an early event in breast cancer, extended periods of cancer cell dormancy can result in long latency of metastasis development. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying cancer cell dormancy and subsequent growth at the metastatic site would facilitate development of strategies to interfere with these processes. A challenge in this undertaking has been the lack of models for cancer cell dormancy. We have established novel experimental systems that model the bone microenvironment of the breast cancer metastatic niche. These systems are based on 3D cocultures of breast cancer cells with cell types predominant in bone marrow. We identified conditions in which cancer cells are dormant and conditions in which they proliferate. Dormant cancer cells were able to proliferate upon transfer into supportive microenvironment or upon manipulation of signaling pathways that control dormancy. These experimental systems will be instrumental for metastasis studies, particularly the study of cellular dormancy.},

Studies reporting this decline primarily attribute it to the sharp decline in menopausal hormone use following publication of the Women's Health Initiative trial results. However, they have not stratified rates by either histologic type or race/ethnicity, which could further inform contributors to these trends. Using data from 13 cancer registries that participate in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we evaluated annual percent changes ({APC}) in breast cancer incidence rates from 1995 to 2004 by histologic type and race/ethnicity for intervals identified using joinpoint regression. Invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma incidence rates fell steadily from 1998 to 2004 [{APC}, -3.07\% (95\% confidence interval, -4.10 to -2.02) and {APC}, -3.18\% (95\% confidence interval, -5.18 to -1.03), respectively]. Declines in rates of breast cancer overall and invasive ductal carcinoma were primarily limited to women {\textgreater} or = 50 years of age and to non-Hispanic whites and Asian/Pacific Islanders, and declines in rates of invasive lobular carcinoma were primarily limited to non-Hispanic whites. The majority of these declines began around 1998 and all began before 2002 when the Women's Health Initiative trial results were published; thus, the abrupt decline in hormone therapy use starting in 2002 is unlikely to be primarily responsible for the recent decline in breast cancer rates. The declines observed thus far are likely attributable to saturation of screening, although further declines related to the widespread cessation of hormone use may follow.},

Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in {\textasciitilde}40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}.

These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘{CNA}-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network.

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is a complex disorder and commonly leads to fractures in elderly persons. Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) have become an unbiased approach to identify variations in the genome that potentially affect health. However, the genetic variants identified so far only explain a small proportion of the heritability for complex traits. Due to the modest genetic effect size and inadequate power, true association signals may not be revealed based on a stringent genome-wide significance threshold. Here, we take advantage of {SNP} and transcript arrays and integrate {GWAS} and expression signature profiling relevant to the skeletal system in cellular and animal models to prioritize the discovery of novel candidate genes for osteoporosis-related traits, including bone mineral density ({BMD}) at the lumbar spine ({LS}) and femoral neck ({FN}), as well as geometric indices of the hip (femoral neck-shaft angle, {NSA}; femoral neck length, {NL}; and narrow-neck width, {NW}). A two-stage meta-analysis of {GWAS} from 7,633 Caucasian women and 3,657 men, revealed three novel loci associated with osteoporosis-related traits, including chromosome 1p13.2 ({RAP}1A, p = 3.6x10(-8)), 2q11.2 ({TBC}1D8), and 18q11.2 ({OSBPL}1A), and confirmed a previously reported region near {TNFRSF}11B/{OPG} gene. We also prioritized 16 suggestive genome-wide significant candidate genes based on their potential involvement in skeletal metabolism. Among them, 3 candidate genes were associated with {BMD} in women. Notably, 2 out of these 3 genes ({GPR}177, p = 2.6x10(-13); {SOX}6, p = 6.4x10(-10)) associated with {BMD} in women have been successfully replicated in a large-scale meta-analysis of {BMD}, but none of the non-prioritized candidates (associated with {BMD}) did. Our results support the concept of our prioritization strategy. In the absence of direct biological support for identified genes, we highlighted the efficiency of subsequent functional characterization using publicly available expression profiling relevant to the skeletal system in cellular or whole animal models to prioritize candidate genes for further functional validation.},

They have been thought to deposit paracrine information and create paths of least resistance, as well as be taken up by cells in the tumor microenvironment to modulate the molecular makeup and behavior of recipient cells. The complexity of their bioactive cargo-which includes proteins, {RNA}, {microRNA}, and {DNA}-suggests multipronged mechanisms by which microvesicles can condition the extracellular milieu to facilitate disease progression. The formation of these shed vesicles likely involves both a redistribution of surface lipids and the vertical trafficking of cargo to sites of microvesicle biogenesis at the cell surface. Current research also suggests that molecular profiling of these structures could unleash their potential as circulating biomarkers as well as platforms for personalized medicine.

However, co-expression networks are often constructed by ad hoc methods, and network-based analyses have not been shown to outperform the conventional cluster analyses, partially due to the lack of an unbiased evaluation metric. {RESULTS}: Here, we develop a general co-expression network-based approach for analyzing both genes and samples in microarray data. Our approach consists of a simple but robust rank-based network construction method, a parameter-free module discovery algorithm and a novel reference network-based metric for module evaluation. We report some interesting topological properties of rank-based co-expression networks that are very different from that of value-based networks in the literature. Using a large set of synthetic and real microarray data, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over several popular existing algorithms. Applications of our approach to yeast, Arabidopsis and human cancer microarray data reveal many interesting modules, including a fatal subtype of lymphoma and a gene module regulating yeast telomere integrity, which were missed by the existing methods. {CONCLUSIONS}: We demonstrated that our novel approach is very effective in discovering the modular structures in microarray data, both for genes and for samples. As the method is essentially parameter-free, it may be applied to large data sets where the number of clusters is difficult to estimate. The method is also very general and can be applied to other types of data. A {MATLAB} implementation of our algorithm can be downloaded from http://cs.utsa.edu/{\textasciitilde}jruan/Software.html.},

	shorttitle = {Human endogenous retroviruses and cancer prevention},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cancer is a significant and growing problem worldwide. While this increase may, in part, be attributed to increasing longevity, improved case notifications and risk-enhancing lifestyle (such as smoking, diet and obesity), hygiene-related factors resulting in immuno-regulatory failure may also play a major role and call for a revision of vaccination strategies to protect against a range of cancers in addition to infections.
{DISCUSSION}: Human endogenous retroviruses ({HERVs}) are a significant component of a wider family of retroelements that constitutes part of the human genome. They were originated by the integration of exogenous retroviruses into the human genome millions of years ago. {HERVs} are estimated to comprise about 8\% of human {DNA} and are ubiquitous in somatic and germinal tissues.Physiologic and pathologic processes are influenced by some biologically active {HERV} families. {HERV} antigens are only expressed at low levels by the host, but in circumstances of inappropriate control their genes may initiate or maintain pathological processes. Although the precise mechanism leading to abnormal {HERVs} gene expression has yet to be clearly elucidated, environmental factors seem to be involved by influencing the human immune system.{HERV}-K expression has been detected in different types of tumors.Among the various human endogenous retroviral families, the K series was the latest acquired by the human species. Probably because of its relatively recent origin, the {HERV}-K is the most complete and biologically active family.The abnormal expression of {HERV}-K seemingly triggers pathological processes leading to melanoma onset, but also contributes to the morphological and functional cellular modifications implicated in melanoma maintenance and progression.The {HERV}-K-{MEL} antigen is encoded by a pseudo-gene incorporated in the {HERV}-K env-gene. {HERV}-K-{MEL} is significantly expressed in the majority of dysplastic and normal naevi, as well as other tumors like sarcoma, lymphoma, bladder and breast cancer. An amino acid sequence similar to {HERV}-K-{MEL}, recognized to cause a significant protective effect against melanoma, is shared by the antigenic determinants expressed by some vaccines such as {BCG}, vaccinia virus and the yellow fever virus.{HERV}-K are also reactivated in the majority of human breast cancers. Monoclonal and single-chain antibodies against the {HERV}-K Env protein recently proved capable of blocking the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro, inhibiting tumor growth in mice bearing xenograft tumors.
{SUMMARY}: A recent epidemiological study provided provisional evidence of how melanoma risk could possibly be reduced if the yellow fever virus vaccine ({YFV}) were received at least 10 years before, possibly preventing tumor initiation rather than culling melanoma cells already compromised. Further research is recommended to confirm the temporal pattern of this protection and eliminate/attenuate the potential role of relevant confounders as socio-economic status and other vaccinations.It appears also appropriate to examine the potential protective effect of {YFV} against other malignancies expressing high levels of {HERV}-K antigens, namely breast cancer, sarcoma, lymphoma and bladder cancer.Tumor immune-therapy, as described for the monoclonal antibodies against breast cancer, is indeed considered more complex and less advantageous than immune-prevention. Cellular immunity possibly triggered by vaccines as for {YFV} might also be involved in anti-cancer response, in addition to humoral immunity.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Conditioned medium was collected from serum starved {MDA}-{MB}-231 sub-confluent cell cultures and exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Ultrastructural analysis of {ELVs} was performed by transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) and the purity of fraction was confirmed by western blotting assays. Proteomic profile of {ELVs} was carried out by 2 D-{PAGE} and protein identification performed by {MALDI}-{ToF} Mass Spectrometry.
{RESULTS}: On the basis of ultrastructural and immunological characterization, the isolated vesicles have been classified as exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}). The proteomic investigation showed a distinctive protein profile of the {ELVs}, in comparison to the whole cell lisates ({WCL}) proteome, which could be instrumental for cancer progression. The proteins were clustered into functional categories, according to the current bioinformatics resources and a Venn diagram was constructed based on these clusters.
{CONCLUSION}: It is reasonable to assume that vesicle production allows neoplastic cells to exert different effects, according to the possible acceptor targets. For instance, vesicles could potentiate the malignant properties of adjacent neoplastic cells or activate non-tumoral cells. Moreover, vesicles could convey signals to immune cells and surrounding stroma cells. The present study may significantly contribute to the knowledge of the vesiculation phenomenon, which is a critical device for trans cellular communication in cancer.},

	abstract = {The lack of targeted therapy for women with triple negative breast cancer demands a "think-outside-the-box" approach in search of novel treatment strategies. Although cancer drug development traditionally focused on targeting the tumor cell cycle, emphasis has recently shifted toward the tumor microenvironment for novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic composite of cells broadly categorized as immune cells and nonimmune cells within a scaffold of extracellular matrix, where tumor cells thrive. Among the various nonimmune cell types, cancer stromal cells have emerged as critical players in promoting tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis as well as interacting with immune cells to tilt the equilibrium toward a tolerogenic environment that favors the tumor cells. In view of recent work that demonstrated that the depletion of fibroblast activation protein ({FAP}) expressing tumor stromal cells resulted in stunted tumor growth and improved response to tumor vaccination, the tumor microenvironment is, therefore, fertile ground for development of novel therapy with the potential of augmenting existing treatment and prevention options. In this review, we will focus on current evidence supporting the role of cancer associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}), with a special focus on {FAP}(+) stromal cells, in promoting tumor growth. The role of {CAFs} in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which may accelerate tumor progression, will be discussed with the hope that therapeutics developed to target the "generic" tumor microenvironment may be effective for malignancies such as triple negative breast cancer, for which targeted therapy is not available to date, in the future.},

	abstract = {Intra-abdominal tumors, such as ovarian cancer, have a clear predilection for metastasis to the omentum, an organ primarily composed of adipocytes. Currently, it is unclear why tumor cells preferentially home to and proliferate in the omentum, yet omental metastases typically represent the largest tumor in the abdominal cavities of women with ovarian cancer. We show here that primary human omental adipocytes promote homing, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and that adipokines including interleukin-8 ({IL}-8) mediate these activities. Adipocyte-ovarian cancer cell coculture led to the direct transfer of lipids from adipocytes to ovarian cancer cells and promoted in vitro and in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, coculture induced lipolysis in adipocytes and β-oxidation in cancer cells, suggesting adipocytes act as an energy source for the cancer cells. A protein array identified upregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 ({FABP}4, also known as {aP}2) in omental metastases as compared to primary ovarian tumors, and {FABP}4 expression was detected in ovarian cancer cells at the adipocyte-tumor cell interface. {FABP}4 deficiency substantially impaired metastatic tumor growth in mice, indicating that {FABP}4 has a key role in ovarian cancer metastasis. These data indicate adipocytes provide fatty acids for rapid tumor growth, identifying lipid metabolism and transport as new targets for the treatment of cancers where adipocytes are a major component of the microenvironment.},

Recent evidence suggests the presence of {KRAS} mutation-associated {CIMP} subtype ({CIMP}-low, {CIMP}2). We used cluster analysis, principal component analysis ({PCA}), and structural equation modeling ({SEM}), a novel strategy, to decipher the correlation structure of {CpG} island hypermethylation. Using a database of 861 colon and rectal cancers, {DNA} methylation at 16 {CpG} islands [{CACNA}1G, {CDKN}2A (p16/ink4a), {CHFR}, {CRABP}1, {HIC}1, {IGF}2, {IGFBP}3, {MGMT}, {MINT}-1, {MINT}-31, {MLH}1, {NEUROG}1, p14 ({CDKN}2A/arf), {RUNX}3, {SOCS}1, and {WRN}] was quantified by real-time {PCR}. Tumors were categorized into three groups: Group 1 with wild-type {KRAS}/{BRAF} (N = 440); Group 2 with mutant {KRAS} and wild-type {BRAF} (N = 308); and Group 3 with wild-type {KRAS} and mutant {BRAF} (N = 107). Tumors with mutant {KRAS}/{BRAF} (N = 6) were excluded. In unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, all but six markers ({CACNA}1G, {IGF}2, {RUNX}3, {MGMT}, {MINT}-1, and {SOCS}1) were differentially clustered with {CIMP}-high and {CIMP}-low according to {KRAS} and {BRAF} status. In {SEM}, the correlation structures between {CIMP}, locus-specific {CpG} island methylation, and {MSI} differed according to {KRAS} and {BRAF} status, which was consistent with {PCA} results. In conclusion, {KRAS} and {BRAF} mutations appear to differentially influence correlation structure of {CpG} island methylation.

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btv197},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Principal component analysis ({PCA}) is a basic tool often used in bioinformatics for visualization and dimension reduction. However, it is known that {PCA} may not consistently estimate the true direction of maximal variability in high-dimensional, low sample size settings, which are typical for molecular data. Assuming that the underlying signal is sparse, i.e. that only a fraction of features contribute to a principal component ({PC}), this estimation consistency can be retained. Most existing sparse {PCA} methods use L1-penalization, i.e. the lasso, to perform feature selection. But, the lasso is known to lack variable selection consistency in high dimensions and therefore a subsequent interpretation of selected features can give misleading results.
{RESULTS}: We present S4VDPCA, a sparse {PCA} method that incorporates a subsampling approach, namely stability selection. S4VDPCA can consistently select the truly relevant variables contributing to a sparse {PC} while also consistently estimate the direction of maximal variability. The performance of the S4VDPCA is assessed in a simulation study and compared to other {PCA} approaches, as well as to a hypothetical oracle {PCA} that 'knows' the truly relevant features in advance and thus finds optimal, unbiased sparse {PCs}. S4VDPCA is computationally efficient and performs best in simulations regarding parameter estimation consistency and feature selection consistency. Furthermore, S4VDPCA is applied to a publicly available gene expression data set of medulloblastoma brain tumors. Features contributing to the first two estimated sparse {PCs} represent genes significantly over-represented in pathways typically deregulated between molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma.

Nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}) was introduced as an unsupervised, parts-based learning paradigm involving the decomposition of a nonnegative matrix V into two nonnegative matrices, W and H, via a multiplicative updates algorithm. In the context of a pxn gene expression matrix V consisting of observations on p genes from n samples, each column of W defines a metagene, and each column of H represents the metagene expression pattern of the corresponding sample. {NMF} has been primarily applied in an unsupervised setting in image and natural language processing. More recently, it has been successfully utilized in a variety of applications in computational biology. Examples include molecular pattern discovery, class comparison and prediction, cross-platform and cross-species analysis, functional characterization of genes and biomedical informatics.

Changes in expression associated with factors such as age, gender or postmortem interval are often more pronounced than changes associated with disease. Therefore in addition to being of interest in their own right, careful consideration of these effects are important in the interpretation of disease studies. We performed a large meta-analysis of genome-wide expression studies of normal human cortex to more fully catalogue the effects of age, gender, postmortem interval and brain {pH}, yielding a "meta-signature" of gene expression changes for each factor. We validated our results by showing a significant overlap with independent gene lists extracted from the literature. Importantly, meta-analysis identifies genes which are not significant in any individual study. Finally, we show that many schizophrenia candidate genes appear in the meta-signatures, reinforcing the idea that studies must be carefully controlled for interactions between these factors and disease. In addition to the inherent value of the meta-signatures, our results provide critical information for future studies of disease effects in the human brain.},

In some cases, cell lines with particular pathobiological phenotypes clustered together (e.g., {ERBB}2 amplified cell lines sharing the same morphometric properties as the grape-like phenotype). Next, associations with molecular features were realized through (i) differential analysis within each morphological cluster, and (ii) regression analysis across the entire panel of cell lines. In both cases, the dominant genes that are predictive of the morphological signatures were identified.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Endocrine therapies of breast cancer are effective but ultimately fail because of the development of treatment resistance. We have previously revealed several genes leading to tamoxifen resistance in vitro by retroviral insertion mutagenesis. To understand the manner in which these genes yield tamoxifen resistance, their effects on global gene expression were studied and those genes resulting in a distinct gene expression profile were further investigated for their clinical relevance.
{METHODS}: Gene expression profiles of 69 human breast cancer cell lines that were made tamoxifen resistant through retroviral insertion mutagenesis were obtained using oligonucleotide arrays and analysed with bioinformatic tools. {mRNA} levels of {NCOR}2 and {CITED}2 in oestrogen receptor-positive breast tumours were determined by quantitative {RT}-{PCR}. {mRNA} levels were evaluated for association with metastasis-free survival ({MFS}) in 620 patients with lymph node-negative primary breast cancer who did not receive systemic adjuvant therapy, and with clinical benefit in 296 patients receiving tamoxifen therapy for recurrent breast cancer.
{RESULTS}: {mRNA} expression profiles of most tamoxifen-resistant cell lines were strikingly similar, except for the subgroups of cell lines in which {NCOR}2 or {CITED}2 were targeted by the retrovirus. Both {NCOR}2 and {CITED}2 {mRNA} levels were associated with {MFS}, that is, tumour aggressiveness, independently of traditional prognostic factors. In addition, high {CITED}2 {mRNA} levels were predictive for a clinical benefit from first-line tamoxifen treatment in patients with advanced disease.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Most retrovirally targeted genes yielding tamoxifen resistance in our cell lines do not impose a distinctive expression profile, suggesting that their causative role in cell growth may be accomplished by post-transcriptional processes. The associations of {NCOR}2 and {CITED}2 with outcome in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients underscore the clinical relevance of functional genetic screens to better understand disease progression, which may ultimately lead to the development of improved treatment options.},

Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing. {RESULTS}: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.},

These data may at least be partly due to the manual interpretation of immunohistochemical staining, especially as survivin can be located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Quantitative determination of survivin expression using image analysis offers the opportunity to develop alternative scoring models for survivin immunohistochemistry. Here, we present such a model. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: A breast cancer tissue microarray containing 102 tumors was stained with an anti-survivin antibody. Whole-slide scanning was used to capture high-resolution images. These images were analyzed using automated algorithms to quantify the staining. {RESULTS}: Increased nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, survivin was associated with a reduced overall survival ({OS}; P = 0.038) and disease-specific survival (P = 0.0015). A high cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio ({CNR}) of survivin was associated with improved {OS} (P = 0.005) and disease-specific survival (P = 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the survivin {CNR} was an independent predictor of {OS} (hazard ratio, 0.09; 95\% confidence interval, 0.01-0.76; P = 0.027). A survivin {CNR} of {\textgreater}5 correlated positively with estrogen receptor (P = 0.019) and progesterone receptor (P = 0.033) levels, whereas it was negatively associated with Ki-67 expression (P = 0.04), p53 status (P = 0.005), and c-myc amplification (P = 0.016). {CONCLUSION}: Different prognostic information is supplied by nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin in breast cancer. Nuclear survivin is a poor prognostic marker in breast cancer. Moreover, {CNR} of survivin, as determined by image analysis, is an independent prognostic factor.},

Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript ({CART}), first isolated from the ovine hypothalamus, is a potential neurotransmitter widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as in endocrine cells in the pituitary and adrenal glands, pancreatic islets and stomach. 2. Numerous studies have established the role of {CART} in food intake, maintenance of bodyweight, stress control, reward and pain transmission. Recently, it was demonstrated that {CART}, as a neurotrophic peptide, had a cerebroprotective against focal ischaemic stroke and inhibited the neurotoxicity of β-amyloid protein, which focused attention on the role of {CART} in the central nervous system ({CNS}) and neurological diseases. 3. In fact, little is known about the way in which {CART} peptide interacts with its receptors, initiates downstream cascades and finally exerts its neuroprotective effect under normal or pathological conditions. The literature indicates that there are many factors, such as regulation of the immunological system and protection against energy failure, that may be involved in the cerebroprotection afforded by {CART}. 4. The present review provides a brief summary of the current literature on {CART} synthesis and active fragments, its distribution in the {CNS} and, in particular, the role of {CART} peptide (and its receptors and signalling) in neurological diseases.},

	abstract = {Periostin ({PN}), a secreted adhesion-related protein expressed in the periosteum and periodontal ligaments, acts as a critical regulator of the formation and maintenance of bone and teeth, and also plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Although {PN} is highly expressed in various types of human cancers, its function is still unclear. In this study, we focused on the exon 17 region of {PN}, which is alternatively spliced out. To investigate the function of full-length {PN} with exon 17, we produced a neutralizing antibody ({PN}1-Ab) against the peptide encoded by exon 17. In vivo, administration of {PN}1-Ab significantly inhibited the growth of primary tumors as well as metastatic tumors, associated with prevention of bone destruction, resulting in increased survival of mice. Consistent with in vivo data, the present in vitro study demonstrated that addition of full-length {PN} significantly inhibited cell adhesion and detached adherent cells, while {PN}1-Ab inhibited the action of {PN} in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, {PN}1-Ab significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells, which produced {PN}. Interestingly, {PN}1-Ab also inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts. Overall, the present study demonstrated that {PN} plays a pivotal role in the progression and metastasis of breast cancer. Since administration of {PN}1-Ab prolonged cell survival through inhibition of the progression and metastasis of 4T1 cells, further development of the {PN}1-Ab such as generation of a humanized antibody may provide a new therapeutic agent against breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Understanding the functional implications of changes in gene expression, mutations, etc., is the aim of most genomic experiments. To achieve this, several functional profiling methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for the discovery of new cell functionalities with complex dependences on more than one variable.},

Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in {\textasciitilde}40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by {CNAs}, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in {PPP}2R2A, {MTAP} and {MAP}2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired {DNA}–{RNA} profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘{CNA}-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic {CNAs} on the transcriptome.},

	abstract = {It was expected that with the advent of genomics, oncology may defeat the deadliest forms of cancer including malignant melanoma, but the past years have indicated that this is not the case. Despite the stunning success of genomics in defining markers or gene signatures for breast cancer prognosis and predicting therapies, there is virtually no progression in malignant melanoma. This is happening when experimental oncology or metastasis research is using several rodent and human melanoma models, when our knowledge on the metastatic cascade is actually derived from these models. Our critical analysis of these studies revealed several factors which might be responsible for this failure. First, it is evident, that these studies must be based on rigorous sample collection and basic pathological considerations, where divergent histological types of melanoma cannot be analysed universally. Secondly, without following basic consideration of metastasis biology, the majority of these studies were rarely based on primary tumors but frequently on various types of regional metastases. Third, successful expression profiling studies on other tumors such as breast cancer, provided evidences that the homogeneity of the patient cohort at least by clinicopathological stage is a critical element when defining prognostic signatures. Four studies attempted to define the prognostic signature of skin melanoma but only one based the study on the primary tumor resulting in heterogenous signatures with a minimal overlap ({MCM}3 and {NFKBIZ}). Four study attempted to define the invasiveness-signature in the primary tumor based on thickness or growth pattern discrimination identifying a 9-gene overlap which proved to be different from the prognostic signatures. On the other hand, seven studies analyzed various types of metastatic tissues (rarely visceral-, mostly cutaneous or lymphatic metastases) to define the metastasis-signatures, again with minimal overlap ({AQP}3, {LGALS}7 and {SFN}). Using seven {GEO}-based melanoma datasets we have performed a meta-analysis of the metastasis-gene signatures using normalization protocols. This analysis identified a 350-gene signature, the core of which was a 17-gene signature characterizing locoregional metastases where the individual components occurred in 3 studies: several members of this signature were extensively studied before in context of melanoma metastasis including {WNT}5A, {EGFR}, {BCL}2A1 and {OPN}. These data suggest that only efficient inter-disciplinary collaboration throughout genomic analysis of human skin melanoma could lead to major advances in defining relevant gene-sets appropriate for clinical prognostication or revealing basic molecular pathways of melanoma progression.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{OBJECTIVES}

Shorter leukocyte telomere length ({LTL}) is associated with several chronic diseases, but only a few studies have assessed the association between dietary factors and {LTL}. Our objective was to study the association between fats, fruits, vegetables and {LTL} in a cross-sectional study design. We hypothesized that intakes of fruits and vegetables would be positively associated with {LTL} and that intakes of fats, and especially saturated fatty acids ({SFAs}), would be negatively associated with {LTL}.


{SUBJECTS}/{METHODS}

{LTL} was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 1942 men and women aged 57-70 years from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study. We assessed the whole diet by a validated semiquantitative 128-item food-frequency questionnaire.


{RESULTS}

In general, there were only a few significant results. However, total fat and {SFA} intake (P=0.04 and 0.01, respectively) were inversely associated with {LTL} in men adjusting for age and energy intake. In women, vegetable intake was positively associated with {LTL} (P=0.05). Men consuming the most butter and least fruits had significantly shorter telomeres than those consuming the lowest amounts of butter and highest amounts of fruits (P=0.05). We found no association between {LTL} and body mass index, waist-hip ratio, smoking, physical activity or educational attainment.


{CONCLUSIONS}

In this cross-sectional study of elderly men and women, there were only a few statistically significant effects of diet, but in general they support the hypothesis that fat and vegetable intakes were associated with {LTL}.},

	abstract = {Notch signaling deregulation is linked to the onset of several tumors including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-{ALL}). Deregulated {microRNA} ({miRNA}) expression is also associated with several cancers, including leukemias. However, the transcriptional regulators of {miRNAs}, as well as the relationships between Notch signaling and {miRNA} deregulation, are poorly understood. To identify {miRNAs} regulated by Notch pathway, we performed microarray-based {miRNA} profiling of several Notch-expressing T-{ALL} models. Among seven {miRNAs}, consistently regulated by overexpressing or silencing Notch3, we focused our attention on {miR}-223, whose putative promoter analysis revealed a conserved {RBPjk} binding site, which was nested to an {NF}-{kB} consensus. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays on the promoter region of {miR}-223 show that both Notch and {NF}-{kB} are novel coregulatory signals of {miR}-223 expression, being able to activate cooperatively the transcriptional activity of {miR}-223 promoter. Notably, the Notch-mediated activation of {miR}-223 represses the tumor suppressor {FBXW}7 in T-{ALL} cell lines. Moreover, we observed the inverse correlation of {miR}-223 and {FBXW}7 expression in a panel of T-{ALL} patient-derived xenografts. Finally, we show that {miR}-223 inhibition prevents T-{ALL} resistance to γ-secretase inhibitor ({GSI}) treatment, suggesting that {miR}-223 could be involved in {GSI} sensitivity and its inhibition may be exploited in target therapy protocols.},

Perturbations in cell-cell interactions are a key feature of cancer. However, little is known about the systematic effects of cell-cell interaction on global gene expression in cancer.


{RESULTS}

We used an ex vivo model to simulate tumor-stroma interaction by systematically co-cultivating breast cancer cells with stromal fibroblasts and determined associated gene expression changes with {cDNA} microarrays. In the complex picture of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction effects, a prominent characteristic was an induction of interferon-response genes ({IRGs}) in a subset of cancer cells. In close proximity to these cancer cells, the fibroblasts secreted type I interferons, which, in turn, induced expression of the {IRGs} in the tumor cells. Paralleling this model, immunohistochemical analysis of human breast cancer tissues showed that {STAT}1, the key transcriptional activator of the {IRGs}, and itself an {IRG}, was expressed in a subset of the cancers, with a striking pattern of elevated expression in the cancer cells in close proximity to the stroma. In vivo, expression of the {IRGs} was remarkably coherent, providing a basis for segregation of 295 early-stage breast cancers into two groups. Tumors with high compared to low expression levels of {IRGs} were associated with significantly shorter overall survival; 59\% versus 80\% at 10 years (log-rank p = 0.001).


{CONCLUSION}

In an effort to deconvolute global gene expression profiles of breast cancer by systematic characterization of heterotypic interaction effects in vitro, we found that an interaction between some breast cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts can induce an interferon-response, and that this response may be associated with a greater propensity for tumor progression.},

	abstract = {Sphingolipids play key roles in cancer, yet our current understanding of sphingolipid function in lung cancer is limited to a few key players. The best characterized of these are sphingosine-1-phosphate and ceramide which are described for their opposing roles in cell fate. However, because sphingolipids as a whole are readily interconverted by a complex enzymatic machinery, no single sphingolipid appears to have exactly one role. Instead, the roles of specific sphingolipids appear to be context specific as demonstrated by findings that ceramide-1-phosphate has both proliferative and apoptotic effects depending on its concentration. Therefore, we present herein several years of research on ceramide, a sphingolipid linked to apoptotic signaling, that is emerging in cancer research for its potential roles in proliferation and cell-to-cell communication via exosomes.Ceramide is a well-studied sphingolipid in both normal and pathological conditions ranging from skin development to lung cancer. Interestingly, several groups have previously reported its increased levels in emphysema patients who are smokers, a patient subpopulation greatly susceptible to lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms through which cigarette smoke ({CS}) and ceramide accumulation lead to lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}) specifically, are unknown.Interestingly, recent studies clearly establish that two signaling pathways are activated during {CS} exposure in the lung airway. One centers on the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase2 ({nSMase}2), an enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide. The other pathway focuses on the oncogenic {EGF} receptor ({EGFR}), which becomes aberrantly activated but not degraded, leading to prolonged proliferative signaling. Recent studies show that these two signaling pathways may actually converge and integrate. Specifically, Goldkorn et al. demonstrated that during {CS} exposure, {EGFR} is favorably co-localized in ceramide-enriched regions of the plasma membrane, proposing that {nSMase}2/ceramide plays a role in the aberrant {EGFR} activation, leading to augmented tumorigenic signaling. Moreover, new findings indicate that {CS} exposure may induce resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors ({TKIs}), used for treatment of {NSCLC}, merely through posttranslational molecular alterations. Furthermore, structural anomalies of the {CS}-activated {EGFR} appear to be supported by the excess ceramide produced by the {CS}-activated {nSMase}2 in the plasma membrane of lung epithelial cells.We present in this chapter the progression of the sphingolipid field in lung cancer using ceramide as an example. However, many crucial questions remain to be answered regarding the role of sphingolipids in lung cancer because of the glut of promising observations.},

While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that, given certain conditions, any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and reveal how stochasticity in single-cell behaviors promotes phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells.},

Exosomes contain various functional proteins, {mRNAs} and {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) that could be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Currently, a standard method for serum exosome isolation is differential ultracentrifugation, but a search for alternative, less time-consuming and labour extensive exosomal isolation method for use in clinical settings is ongoing. The effect of serum exosome isolation method on obtained {miRNA} profile is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to determine to which extent selected exosome isolation methods influence the serum exosomal {miRNA} profile.
{DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Exosomes were isolated from blood serum of healthy individuals by ultracentrifugation and {ExoQuick} Precipitation methods. The expression profile of 375 {miRNAs} was determined by real time {PCR} using Exiqon {miRCURY} {LNA}™ {microRNA} Human panel I assays.
{RESULTS}: Although a strong correlation of exosomal {miRNA} profiles was observed between the two isolation methods, distinct clusters of {miRNA} levels between the used methods were identified. The detected levels of two {miRNAs}, {miR}-92a and {miR}-486-5p, were significantly influenced by the exosome isolation method used.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Both exosome isolation methods are suitable for serum exosomal {miRNA} profiling. Differences found in {miRNA} patterns between the two methods indicate that the observed exosomal {miRNA} profile is slightly affected by the extracellular vesicle isolation method.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Systems biology refers to multidisciplinary approaches designed to uncover emergent properties of biological systems. Stem cells are an attractive target for this analysis, due to their broad therapeutic potential. A central theme of systems biology is the use of computational modeling to reconstruct complex systems from a wealth of reductionist, molecular data (e.g., gene/protein expression, signal transduction activity, metabolic activity, etc.). A number of deterministic, probabilistic, and statistical learning models are used to understand sophisticated cellular behaviors such as protein expression during cellular differentiation and the activity of signaling networks. However, many of these models are bimodal i.e., they only consider row-column relationships. In contrast, multiway modeling techniques (also known as tensor models) can analyze multimodal data, which capture much more information about complex behaviors such as cell differentiation. In particular, tensors can be very powerful tools for modeling the dynamic activity of biological networks over time. Here, we review the application of systems biology to stem cells and illustrate application of tensor analysis to model collagen-induced osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells.
{RESULTS}: We applied Tucker1, Tucker3, and Parallel Factor Analysis ({PARAFAC}) models to identify protein/gene expression patterns during extracellular matrix-induced osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. In one case, we organized our data into a tensor of type protein/gene locus link x gene ontology category x osteogenic stimulant, and found that our cells expressed two distinct, stimulus-dependent sets of functionally related genes as they underwent osteogenic differentiation. In a second case, we organized {DNA} microarray data in a three-way tensor of gene {IDs} x osteogenic stimulus x replicates, and found that application of tensile strain to a collagen I substrate accelerated the osteogenic differentiation induced by a static collagen I substrate.
{CONCLUSION}: Our results suggest gene- and protein-level models whereby stem cells undergo transdifferentiation to osteoblasts, and lay the foundation for mechanistic, hypothesis-driven studies. Our analysis methods are applicable to a wide range of stem cell differentiation models.},

To achieve this, several functional profiling methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for the discovery of new cell functionalities with complex dependences on more than one variable.},

The unique stromal-epithelial interactions, and more generally, microenvironmental features of basal-like breast cancers have not been well characterized. To identify characteristic microenvironment features of basal-like breast cancer, we performed cocultures of several basal-like breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts and compared these with cocultures of luminal breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts. Interactions between basal-like cancer cells and fibroblasts induced expression of numerous interleukins and chemokines, including {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {CXCL}1, {CXCL}3, and {TGFβ}. Under the influence of fibroblasts, basal-like breast cancer cell lines also showed increased migration in vitro. Migration was less pronounced for luminal lines; but, these lines were more likely to have altered proliferation. These differences were relevant to tumor biology in vivo, as the gene set that distinguished luminal and basal-like stromal interactions in coculture also distinguishes basal-like from luminal tumors with 98\% accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation and 100\% accuracy in an independent test set. However, comparisons between cocultures where cells were in direct contact and cocultures where interaction was solely through soluble factors suggest that there is an important impact of direct cell-to-cell contact. The phenotypes and gene expression changes invoked by cancer cell interactions with fibroblasts support the microenvironment and cell-cell interactions as intrinsic features of breast cancer subtypes.},

Only limited data on the response of {CAFs} to chemotherapy and their potential impact on therapy outcome are available. This study was undertaken to analyze the influence of chemotherapy on carcinoma-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) in vitro and in vivo.
{METHODS}: The in vivo response of stromal cells to chemotherapy was investigated in 22 neoadjuvant treated breast tumors on tissue sections before and after chemotherapy. Response to chemotherapy was analyzed in vitro in primary cultures of isolated {CAFs} from 28 human lung and 9 breast cancer tissues. The response was correlated to Mdm2, {ERCC}1 and {TP}53 polymorphisms and {TP}53 mutation status. Additionally, the cytotoxic effects were evaluated in an ex vivo experiment using cultured tissue slices from 16 lung and 17 breast cancer specimens.
{RESULTS}: Nine of 22 tumors showed a therapy-dependent reduction of stromal activity. Pathological response of tumor or stroma cells did not correlate with clinical response. Isolated {CAFs} showed little sensitivity to paclitaxel. In contrast, sensitivity of {CAFs} to cisplatinum was highly variable with a {GI}50 ranging from 2.8 to 29.0 {microM} which is comparable to the range observed in tumor cell lines. No somatic {TP}53 mutation was detected in any of the 28 {CAFs} from lung cancer tissue. In addition, response to cisplatinum was not significantly associated with the genotype of {TP}53 nor Mdm2 and {ERCC}1 polymorphisms. However, we observed a non-significant trend towards decreased sensitivity in the presence of {TP}53 variant genotype. In contrast to the results obtained in isolated cell culture, in tissue slice culture breast cancer {CAFs} responded to paclitaxel within their microenvironment in the majority of cases (9/14). The opposite was observed in lung cancer tissues: only few {CAFs} were sensitive to cisplatinum within their microenvironment (2/15) whereas a higher proportion responded to cisplatinum in isolated culture.
{CONCLUSION}: Similar to cancer cells, {CAF} response to chemotherapy is highly variable. Beside significant individual/intrinsic differences the sensitivity of {CAFs} seems to depend also on the cancer type as well as the microenvironment.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: A gene expression signature indicative of activated wound responses is common to more than 90\% of non-neoplastic tissues adjacent to breast cancer, but these tissues also exhibit substantial heterogeneity. We hypothesized that gene expression subtypes of breast cancer microenvironment can be defined and that these microenvironment subtypes have clinical relevance.
{METHODS}: Gene expression was evaluated in 72 patient-derived breast tissue samples adjacent to invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Unsupervised clustering identified two distinct gene expression subgroups that differed in expression of genes involved in activation of fibrosis, cellular movement, cell adhesion and cell-cell contact. We evaluated the prognostic relevance of extratumoral subtype (comparing the Active group, defined by high expression of fibrosis and cellular movement genes, to the Inactive group, defined by high expression of claudins and other cellular adhesion and cell-cell contact genes) using clinical data. To establish the biological characteristics of these subtypes, gene expression profiles were compared against published and novel tumor and tumor stroma-derived signatures (Twist-related protein 1 ({TWIST}1) overexpression, transforming growth factor beta ({TGF}-β)-induced fibroblast activation, breast fibrosis, claudin-low tumor subtype and estrogen response). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tissues representing each microenvironment subtype were performed to evaluate protein expression and compositional differences between microenvironment subtypes.
{RESULTS}: Extratumoral Active versus Inactive subtypes were not significantly associated with overall survival among all patients (hazard ratio ({HR}) = 1.4, 95\% {CI} 0.6 to 2.8, P = 0.337), but there was a strong association with overall survival among estrogen receptor ({ER}) positive patients ({HR} = 2.5, 95\% {CI} 0.9 to 6.7, P = 0.062) and hormone-treated patients ({HR} = 2.6, 95\% {CI} 1.0 to 7.0, P = 0.045). The Active subtype of breast microenvironment is correlated with {TWIST}-overexpression signatures and shares features of claudin-low breast cancers. The Active subtype was also associated with expression of {TGF}-β induced fibroblast activation signatures, but there was no significant association between Active/Inactive microenvironment and desmoid type fibrosis or estrogen response gene expression signatures. Consistent with the {RNA} expression profiles, Active cancer-adjacent tissues exhibited higher density of {TWIST} nuclear staining, predominantly in epithelium, and no evidence of increased fibrosis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results document the presence of two distinct subtypes of microenvironment, with Active versus Inactive cancer-adjacent extratumoral microenvironment influencing the aggressiveness and outcome of {ER}-positive human breast cancers.},

The current work aims to externally validate this finding and characterize the underlying biology.  Methods:    We conducted an analysis of 4,657 metastatic {RCC} ({mRCC}) patients (pts) treated on phase {II}-{III} clinical trials sponsored by Pfizer from 2003-2013. We assessed the impact of {BMI} on overall survival ({OS}), progression-free survival ({PFS}) and overall response rate ({ORR}). Additionally, we analysed metastatic pts from the clear cell {RCC} ({ccRCC}) cohort of {TCGA} dataset to correlate the expression of Fatty Acid Synthase ({FASN}) with {BMI} and {OS}.  Results:    At targeted therapy ({TT}) initiation, 1,829 (39\%) pts were normal or underweight ({BMI} {\textless}25 kg/m2) and 2,828 (61\%) were overweight or obese ({BMI} ≥25 kg/m2). Overall, the high {BMI} group had a longer median {OS} (23.4 months) than the low {BMI} group (14.5 months) (hazard ratio ({HR}) = 0.830, p= 0.0008, 95\% {CI} 0.743-0.925) after adjusting for the {IMDC} prognostic risk group and other risks factors. In addition, pts with high {BMI} had improved {PFS} ({HR}=0.821, 95\% {CI} 0.746-0.903, p{\textless}0.0001) and {ORR} (odds ratio =1.527, 95\% {CI} 1.258-1.855, p{\textless}0.001). These results remain valid when stratified by line of therapy. When stratified by histological subtype, the favorable outcome associated with high {BMI} was only observed in {ccRCC}. Toxicity patterns did not differ between {BMI} groups. In the the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) dataset (n=61), there was a trend towards improved {OS} in the high {BMI} group (p=0.07). {FASN} gene expression inversely correlated with both {OS} (p=0.002) and {BMI} (p=0.034).  Conclusions:  In an external cohort,we validate {BMI} as an independent prognostic factor for improved survival in {mRCC}. Given that this finding was observed in {ccRCC} only, we hypothesize that lipid metabolism may be modulated by the fat laden tumors cells. {FASN} staining in the {IMDC} cohort is ongoing to better investigate the obesity paradox in {mRCC}.},

	abstract = {{HIV}-1 drug resistance is a major clinical problem. Resistance is evaluated using in vitro assays measuring the fold change in {IC}(50) caused by resistance mutations. Antiretroviral drugs are used at concentrations above {IC}(50), however, and inhibition at clinical concentrations can only be predicted from {IC}(50) if the shape of the dose-response curve is also known. Curve shape is influenced by cooperative interactions and is described mathematically by the slope parameter or Hill coefficient (m). Implicit in current analysis of resistance is the assumption that mutations shift dose-response curves to the right without affecting the slope. We show here that m is altered by resistance mutations. For reverse transcriptase and fusion inhibitors, single resistance mutations affect both slope and {IC}(50). For protease inhibitors, single mutations primarily affect slope. For integrase inhibitors, only {IC}(50) is affected. Thus, there are fundamental pharmacodynamic differences in resistance to different drug classes. Instantaneous inhibitory potential ({IIP}), the log inhibition of single-round infectivity at clinical concentrations, takes into account both slope and {IC}(50), and thus provides a direct measure of the reduction in susceptibility produced by mutations and the residual activity of drugs against resistant viruses. The standard measure, fold change in {IC}(50), does not correlate well with changes in {IIP} when mutations alter slope. These results challenge a fundamental assumption underlying current analysis of {HIV}-1 drug resistance and suggest that a more complete understanding of how resistance mutations reduce antiviral activity requires consideration of a previously ignored parameter, the dose-response curve slope.},

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in {\textasciitilde}40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by {CNAs}, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in {PPP}2R2A, {MTAP} and {MAP}2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired {DNA}–{RNA} profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘{CNA}-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic {CNAs} on the transcriptome.},

Cells exchange information through a multitude of mechanisms such as secreted growth factors and chemokines, small molecules (peptides, ions, bioactive lipids and nucleotides), cell-cell contact and the secretion of extracellular matrix components. Over the last few years, however, a considerable amount of experimental evidence has demonstrated the occurrence of a sophisticated method of cell communication based on the release of specialized membranous nano-sized vesicles termed exosomes. Exosome biogenesis involves the endosomal compartment, the multivesicular bodies ({MVB}), which contain internal vesicles packed with an extraordinary set of molecules including enzymes, cytokines, nucleic acids and different bioactive compounds. In response to stimuli, {MVB} fuse with the plasma membrane and vesicles are released in the extracellular space where they can interact with neighboring cells and directly induce a signaling pathway or affect the cellular phenotype through the transfer of new receptors or even genetic material. This review will focus on exosomes as intercellular signaling organelles involved in a number of physiological as well as pathological processes and their potential use in clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.},

However, methods for measuring expression typically involve a trade-off between imaging-based methods, which give the precise location of a limited number of genes, and higher throughput methods such as {RNA}-seq, which include all genes, but are more limited in their resolution to apply to many tissues. We propose an intermediate method, which estimates expression in individual cells, based on high-throughput measurements of expression from multiple overlapping groups of cells. This approach has particular benefits in organisms such as C. elegans where invariant developmental patterns make it possible to define these overlapping populations of cells at single-cell resolution.
{RESULT}: We implement several methods to deconvolve the gene expression in individual cells from population-level data and determine the accuracy of these estimates on simulated data from the C. elegans embryo.
{CONCLUSION}: These simulations suggest that a high-resolution map of expression in the C. elegans embryo may be possible with expression data from as few as 30 cell populations.},

Single cell suspensions were generated from colorectal tumour biopsies and tumour parenchyma was separated using {FACS}. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting allowed reliable estimation and purification of cell populations, generating parenchymal purity above 90\%. {RNA} from {FACS}-purified and corresponding whole tumour biopsies was hybridised to Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. Whole tumour and parenchymal samples demonstrated differential gene expression, with 289 genes significantly overexpressed in the whole tumour, many of which were consistent with stromal gene expression (e.g., {COL}6A3, {COL}1A2, {POSTN}, {TIMP}2). Genes characteristic of colorectal carcinoma were overexpressed in the {FACS}-purified cells (e.g., {HOX}2D and {RHOB}). We found {FACS} to be a robust method for generating samples for gene expression analysis, allowing simultaneous assessment of parenchymal and stromal compartments.

However, co-expression networks are often constructed by ad hoc methods, and network-based analyses have not been shown to outperform the conventional cluster analyses, partially due to the lack of an unbiased evaluation metric. {RESULTS}: Here, we develop a general co-expression network-based approach for analyzing both genes and samples in microarray data. Our approach consists of a simple but robust rank-based network construction method, a parameter-free module discovery algorithm and a novel reference network-based metric for module evaluation. We report some interesting topological properties of rank-based co-expression networks that are very different from that of value-based networks in the literature. Using a large set of synthetic and real microarray data, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over several popular existing algorithms. Applications of our approach to yeast, Arabidopsis and human cancer microarray data reveal many interesting modules, including a fatal subtype of lymphoma and a gene module regulating yeast telomere integrity, which were missed by the existing methods. {CONCLUSIONS}: We demonstrated that our novel approach is very effective in discovering the modular structures in microarray data, both for genes and for samples. As the method is essentially parameter-free, it may be applied to large data sets where the number of clusters is difficult to estimate. The method is also very general and can be applied to other types of data. A {MATLAB} implementation of our algorithm can be downloaded from http://cs.utsa.edu/{\textasciitilde}jruan/Software.html.},

We quantified by cytometry exosomes in plasma of 91 colorectal cancer patients to evaluate their potential as a tumor indicator and their repercussions on diagnosis and prognosis. We examined the involvement of {TSAP}6, a {TP}53-regulated gene involved in the regulation of vesicular secretion, in levels of circulating exosomes in plasma of colorectal patients and in {HCT}116 {TP}53-(wild-type and null) human colorectal cancer cell lines. The fraction of exosomes in cancer patients was statistically higher than in healthy controls (mean rank ¼ 53.93 vs. 24.35). High levels of exosomes in plasma of patients correlated with high levels of carcino-embryonic antigen (P ¼ 0.029) and with poorly differentiated tumors (P ¼ 0.039) and tended to have shorter overall survival than patients with low levels (P ¼ 0.056). Release of exosomes did not correlate with {TSAP}6 expression; and regulation of {TSAP}6 by {TP}53 was not shown either in tumor samples or in {HCT}116 cell lines. Although it was not suggested that the {TP}53/{TSAP}6 pathway regulates the release of exosomes into the plasma of colorectal cancer patients, the level of circulating exosomes may be used as a tumor indicator, because it correlates with poor prognosis parameters and shorter survival.},

The unique stromal-epithelial interactions, and more generally, microenvironmental features of basal-like breast cancers have not been well characterized. To identify characteristic microenvironment features of basal-like breast cancer, we performed cocultures of several basal-like breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts and compared these with cocultures of luminal breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts. Interactions between basal-like cancer cells and fibroblasts induced expression of numerous interleukins and chemokines, including {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {CXCL}1, {CXCL}3, and {TGFβ}. Under the influence of fibroblasts, basal-like breast cancer cell lines also showed increased migration in vitro. Migration was less pronounced for luminal lines; but, these lines were more likely to have altered proliferation. These differences were relevant to tumor biology in vivo, as the gene set that distinguished luminal and basal-like stromal interactions in coculture also distinguishes basal-like from luminal tumors with 98\% accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation and 100\% accuracy in an independent test set. However, comparisons between cocultures where cells were in direct contact and cocultures where interaction was solely through soluble factors suggest that there is an important impact of direct cell-to-cell contact. The phenotypes and gene expression changes invoked by cancer cell interactions with fibroblasts support the microenvironment and cell-cell interactions as intrinsic features of breast cancer subtypes.},

In primary human keratinocytes transformed by Ras and I kappa B alpha, c-Myc increases the fraction of tumor-initiating cells by 150-fold, enabling tumor formation and serial propagation with as few as 500 cells. c-Myc-enhanced tumor initiation is cell-autonomous and independent of genomic instability.

We provide a short overview of the general characteristics of natural language data, existing biomedical literature databases, and lexical resources relevant in the context of biomedical text mining. A selected number of practically useful systems are introduced together with the type of user queries supported and the results they generate. The extraction of biological relationships, such as protein-protein interactions as well as metabolic and signaling pathways using information extraction systems, will be discussed through example cases of cancer-relevant proteins. Basic strategies for detecting associations of genes to diseases together with literature mining of mutations, {SNPs}, and epigenetic information (methylation) are described. We provide an overview of disease-centric and gene-centric literature mining methods for linking genes to phenotypic and genotypic aspects. Moreover, we discuss recent efforts for finding biomarkers through text mining and for gene list analysis and prioritization. Some relevant issues for implementing a customized biomedical text mining system will be pointed out. To demonstrate the usefulness of literature mining for the molecular oncology domain, we implemented two cancer-related applications. The first tool consists of a literature mining system for retrieving human mutations together with supporting articles. Specific gene mutations are linked to a set of predefined cancer types. The second application consists of a text categorization system supporting breast cancer-specific literature search and document-based breast cancer gene ranking. Future trends in text mining emphasize the importance of community efforts such as the {BioCreative} challenge for the development and integration of multiple systems into a common platform provided by the {BioCreative} Metaserver.},

In the mixed lesions, both the invasive and the {DCIS} components showed the same mutation in all 5 cases where the two components were successfully microdissected. Presence of the same mutation in both {DCIS} and invasive components from the same tumor indicates same cellular origin.

However, for many cancer subtypes, including triple‐negative breast cancer ({TNBC}), no frequently recurring aberrations could be identified to make such an approach clinically feasible. Characterized by a highly heterogeneous mutational landscape with few common features, many {TNBCs} cluster together based on their ‘basal‐like’ transcriptional profiles. We therefore hypothesized that targeting {TNBC} cells on a systems level by exploiting the transcriptional cell state might be a viable strategy to find novel therapies for this highly aggressive disease. We performed a large‐scale chemical genetic screen and identified a group of compounds related to the drug {PKC}412 (midostaurin). {PKC}412 induced apoptosis in a subset of {TNBC} cells enriched for the basal‐like subtype and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. We employed a multi‐omics approach and computational modeling to address the mechanism of action and identified spleen tyrosine kinase ({SYK}) as a novel and unexpected target in {TNBC}. Quantitative phosphoproteomics revealed that {SYK} inhibition abrogates signaling to {STAT}3, explaining the selectivity for basal‐like breast cancer cells. This non‐oncogene addiction suggests that chemical {SYK} inhibition may be beneficial for a specific subset of {TNBC} patients and demonstrates that targeting cell states could be a viable strategy to discover novel treatment strategies.
Synopsis



A chemical screen and systems approach reveal {SYK}‐{STAT}3 signaling as a druggable target in basal‐like breast cancers. The study supports the systems‐based notion that targeting a cell state, rather than a mutational state, can lead to therapeutic target discovery.

A chemical screen identifies a set of structurally related small molecules, including the drug midostaurin ({PKC}412), that target the mesenchymal cell state found in a subset of breast tumors.A multi‐omics approach is combined with computational modeling for examining the drug mechanism of action and reveals the tyrosine kinase {SYK} as a novel breast cancer target.Phospho‐proteomics analysis shows that {SYK} is required to maintain {STAT}3 phosphorylation in basal‐like breast cancer cells.},

	abstract = {{STATIS} is an extension of principal component analysis ({PCA}) tailored to handle multiple data tables that measure sets of variables collected on the same observations, or, alternatively, as in a variant called dual-{STATIS}, multiple data tables where the same variables are measured on different sets of observations. {STATIS} proceeds in two steps: First it analyzes the between data table similarity structure and derives from this analysis an optimal set of weights that are used to compute a linear combination of the data tables called the compromise that best represents the information common to the different data tables; Second, the {PCA} of this compromise gives an optimal map of the observations. Each of the data tables also provides a map of the observations that is in the same space as the optimum compromise map. In this article, we present {STATIS}, explain the criteria that it optimizes, review the recent inferential extensions to {STATIS} and illustrate it with a detailed example.We also review, and present in a common framework, the main developments of {STATIS} such as (1) X-{STATIS} or partial triadic analysis ({PTA}) which is used when all data tables collect the same variables measured on the same observations (e.g., at different times or locations), (2) {COVSTATIS}, which handles multiple covariance matrices collected on the same observations, (3) {DISTATIS}, which handles multiple distance matrices collected on the same observations and generalizes metric multidimensional scaling to three way distance matrices, (4) Canonical-{STATIS} ({CANOSTATIS}), which generalizes discriminant analysis and combines it with {DISTATIS} to analyze multitable discriminant analysis problems, (5) power-{STATIS}, which uses alternative criteria to find {STATIS} optimal weights, (6) {ANISOSTATIS}, which extends {STATIS} to give specific weights to each variable rather than to each whole table, (7) (K + 1)-{STATIS} (or external-{STATIS}), which extends {STATIS} (and {PLS}-methods and Tucker inter battery analysis) to the analysis of the relationships of several data sets and one external data set, and (8) double-{STATIS} (or {DO}-{ACT}), which generalizes (K + 1)-{STATIS} and analyzes two sets of data tables, and {STATIS}-4, which generalizes double-{STATIS} to more than two sets of data.These recent developments are illustrated by small examples. {WIREs} Comput Stat 2012, 4:124–167. doi: 10.1002/wics.198For further resources related to this article, please visit the {WIREs} website},

Breast cancers found in {BRCA}1 mutation carriers are also frequently triple negative and basal like. {TNBC} and {BLBC} occur most frequently in young women, especially African Americans, and tend to exhibit aggressive, metastatic behavior. These tumors respond to conventional chemotherapy but relapse more frequently than hormone receptor-positive, luminal subtypes and have a worse prognosis.

Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis ({SGCCA}) is proposed to combine {RGCCA} with an [Formula: see text]-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes {SGCCA} a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems.

	abstract = {Exosome secretion is a notable feature of malignancy owing to the roles of these nanoparticles in cancer growth, immune suppression, tumor angiogenesis and therapeutic resistance. Exosomes are 30–100 nm membrane vesicles released by many cells types during normal physiological processes. Tumors aberrantly secrete large quantities of exosomes that transport oncoproteins and immune suppressive molecules to support tumor growth and metastasis. The role of exosomes in intercellular signaling is exemplified by human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ({HER}2) over-expressing breast cancer, where exosomes with the {HER}2 oncoprotein stimulate tumor growth and interfere with the activity of the therapeutic antibody Herceptin®. Since numerous observations from experimental model systems point toward an important clinical impact of exosomes in cancer, several pharmacological strategies have been proposed for targeting their malignant activities. We also propose a novel device strategy involving extracorporeal hemofiltration of exosomes from the entire circulatory system using an affinity plasmapheresis platform known as the Aethlon {ADAPT}™ (adaptive dialysis-like affinity platform technology) system, which would overcome the risks of toxicity and drug interactions posed by pharmacological approaches. This technology allows affinity agents, including exosome-binding lectins and antibodies, to be immobilized in the outer-capillary space of plasma filtration membranes that integrate into existing kidney dialysis systems. Device therapies that evolve from this platform allow rapid extracorporeal capture and selective retention of target particles {\textless} 200 nm from the entire circulatory system. This strategy is supported by clinical experience in hepatitis C virus-infected patients using an {ADAPT}™ device, the Hemopurifier®, to reduce the systemic load of virions having similar sizes and glycosylated surfaces as cancer exosomes. This review discusses the possible therapeutic approaches for targeting immune suppressive exosomes in cancer patients, and the anticipated significance of these strategies for reversing immune dysfunction and improving responses to standard of care treatments.},

To identify candidate genes involved in causal pathways of aggressive prostate cancer, we implemented a systems biology approach by combining differential expression analysis and coexpression network analysis to evaluate transcriptional profiles using lymphoblastoid cell lines from 62 prostate cancer patients with aggressive phenotype (Gleason grade {\textgreater}or= 8) and 63 prostate cancer patients with nonaggressive phenotype (Gleason grade {\textless}0.01. We also identified a coexpression module demonstrating significant association with the aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer (P = 3.67 x 10(-11)). The module of interest was characterized by overrepresentation of cell cycle-related genes ({FDR} = 3.50 x 10(-50)). From this module, we further defined 20 hub genes that were highly connected to other genes. Interestingly, 5 of the 7 differentially expressed {miRNAs} have been implicated in cell cycle regulation and 2 ({miR}-145 and {miR}-331-3p) are predicted to target 3 of the 20 hub genes. Ectopic expression of these two {miRNAs} reduced expression of target hub genes and subsequently resulted in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. These results suggest that cell cycle is likely to be a molecular pathway causing aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer. Further characterization of cell cycle-related genes (particularly, the hub genes) and {miRNAs} that regulate these hub genes could facilitate identification of candidate genes responsible for the aggressive phenotype and lead to a better understanding of prostate cancer etiology and progression.},

Three-way matrices, such as the one proposed here, are difficult to handle and to analyse by classical multivariate statistical tools and thus should be treated with approaches dealing with three-way data structures. One possible analysis approach is the use of Partial Triadic Analysis ({PTA}). Applied to the dataset of the Luxembourg Sandstone aquifer, the {PTA} appears to be a new promising statistical instrument for hydrogeologists, for characterization of temporal or spatial hydrochemical variations induced by natural and anthropogenic factors.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: There is evidence that genes and their protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways. Gene co-expression networks have been used to describe the relationships between gene transcripts. Ample literature exists on how to detect biologically meaningful modules in networks but there is a need for methods that allow one to study the relationships between modules. {RESULTS}: We show that network methods can also be used to describe the relationships between co-expression modules and present the following methodology. First, we describe several methods for detecting modules that are shared by two or more networks (referred to as consensus modules). We represent the gene expression profiles of each module by an eigengene. Second, we propose a method for constructing an eigengene network, where the edges are undirected but maintain information on the sign of the co-expression information. Third, we propose methods for differential eigengene network analysis that allow one to assess the preservation of network properties across different data sets. We illustrate the value of eigengene networks in studying the relationships between consensus modules in human and chimpanzee brains; the relationships between consensus modules in brain, muscle, liver, and adipose mouse tissues; and the relationships between male-female mouse consensus modules and clinical traits. In some applications, we find that module eigengenes can be organized into higher level clusters which we refer to as meta-modules. {CONCLUSION}: Eigengene networks can be effective and biologically meaningful tools for studying the relationships between modules of a gene co-expression network. The proposed methods may reveal a higher order organization of the transcriptome.

However, whether these microenvironmental alterations relate to clinicopathological features is unknown. {OBJECTIVE} To analyze the relationship between stromal genomic alterations and presenting clinicopathological features in sporadic breast cancer. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS} A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of {DNA} from the epithelium and stroma of 220 primary sporadic invasive breast carcinomas for global genomic alterations manifested by loss of heterozygosity/allelic imbalance with 386 microsatellite markers. Data were collected from October 2003 through June 2006 from samples at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Mass. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES} Association of the loss of heterozygosity/allelic imbalance, in both the stroma and epithelium, with presenting clinicopathological features, such as tumor grade, expression status of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, clinical stage, and regional lymph node metastasis status. Associations were assessed in regression models and tested with Fisher exact test. Bonferroni correction was applied to P values, with significance set at P{\textless}.0022. {RESULTS} We found significant associations between loss of heterozygosity/allelic imbalance on chromosome 11 in the stroma and tumor grade (P = .0013), on chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 18, 20, and 22 in the stroma and regional lymph node metastasis (P = .0002-.0016), and on chromosome 14 in the epithelium and progesterone-receptor expression status (P = .002). Specific markers contributing to the loss of heterozygosity/allelic imbalance on chromosome 11 in the stroma associated with tumor grade were D11S1999 (P = .00055) and D11S1986 (P = .042). The loss of heterozygosity/allelic imbalance at various markers in the stroma was significantly associated with regional lymph node metastasis: {ATA}42G12 (chromosome 1, P = .00095), D5S1457 (P = .00095), D5S1501 (P = .0011), D5S816 (P = .0008), D18S858 (P = .0026), D20S103 (P = .0027), D20S851 (P = .0045), D22S683 (P = .00033), and D22S1045 (P = .0013). {CONCLUSIONS} There were more correlations between clinicopathological features and the loss of heterozygosity/allelic imbalance in the stroma than in the epithelium, suggesting that stromal genomic alterations may help account for clinical diversity. Future research is necessary to validate these results and investigate their significance for prognosis and outcome.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: It is often desirable to separate effects of different regulators on gene expression, or to identify effects of the same regulator across several systems. Here, we focus on the rat brain following stroke or seizures, and demonstrate how the two tasks can be approached simultaneously.
{RESULTS}: We applied {SVD} to time-series gene expression datasets from the rat experimental models of stroke and seizures. We demonstrate conservation of two eigensystems, reflecting inflammation and/or apoptosis (eigensystem 2) and neuronal synaptic activity (eigensystem 3), between the stroke and seizures. We analyzed cis-regulation of gene expression in the subspaces of the conserved eigensystems. Bayesian networks analysis was performed separately for either experimental model, with cross-system validation of the highest-ranking features. In this way, we correctly re-discovered the role of {AP}1 in the regulation of apoptosis, and the involvement of Creb and Egr in the regulation of synaptic activity-related genes. We identified a novel antagonistic effect of the motif recognized by the nuclear matrix attachment region-binding protein Satb1 on {AP}1-driven transcriptional activation, suggesting a link between chromatin loop structure and gene activation by {AP}1. The effects of motifs binding Satb1 and Creb on gene expression in brain conform to the assumption of the linear response model of gene regulation. Our data also suggest that numerous enhancers of neuronal-specific genes are important for their responsiveness to the synaptic activity.
{CONCLUSION}: Eigensystems conserved between stroke and seizures separate effects of inflammation/apoptosis and neuronal synaptic activity, exerted by different transcription factors, on gene expression in rat brain.},

	issn = {1949-2553},
	abstract = {Recently, we have shown that macrophage ({MΦ})-induced invasion of breast cancer cells requires upregulation of Wnt 5a in {MΦ} leading to activation of β-Catenin-independent Wnt signaling in the tumor cells. However, it remained unclear, how malignant cells induce Wnt 5a in {MΦ} and how it is transferred back to the cancer cells. Here we identify two types of extracellular particles as essential for this intercellular interaction in both directions. Plasma membrane-derived microvesicles ({MV}) as well as exosomes from breast cancer cells, although biologically distinct populations, both induce Wnt 5a in {MΦ}. In contrast, the particle-free supernatant and vesicles from benign cells, such as platelets, have no such effect. Induction is antagonized by the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1. Subsequently, Wnt 5a is shuttled via responding {MΦ}-{MV} and exosomes to the tumor cells enhancing their invasion. Wnt 5a export on both vesicle fractions depends at least partially on the cargo protein Evenness interrupted (Evi). Its knockdown leads to Wnt 5a depletion of both particle populations and reduced vesicle-mediated invasion. In conclusion, {MV} and exosomes are critical for {MΦ}-induced invasion of cancer cells since they are responsible for upregulation of {MΦ}-Wnt 5a as well as for its delivery to the recipient cells via a reciprocal loop. Although of different biogenesis, both populations share common features regarding function and Evi-dependent secretion of non-canonical Wnts.},

	abstract = {Patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma ({ccRCC}) have divergent survival outcomes and therapeutic responses, which may be determined by underlying molecular diversity. We aimed to develop a practical molecular assay that can identify subtypes with differential prognosis and response to targeted therapy. Whole-genome expression analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ({FFPE}) material from 55 {ccRCC} patients was performed and two molecular subtypes with differential clinical outcomes were identified by hierarchical clustering. An eight-gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for classification into two subtypes was developed for {FFPE} material. The primary objective was to assess assay performance by correlating {ccRCC} prognostic subtypes to cancer-specific survival ({CSS}) and, for patients receiving targeted therapy, radiologic response. In three validation cohorts, patients could be distinguished into prognostic subtypes with differential {CSS} (Singapore General Hospital {FFPE} cohort: n = 224; p = 1.48 × 10(-8); the Cancer Genome Atlas {RNA}-Sequencing cohort: n = 419; p = 3.06 × 10(-7); Van Andel Research Institute microarray cohort: n=174; p=0.00743). For 48 patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor ({TKI}) treatment, the prognostic classification was associated with radiologic response to treatment (p = 5.96 × 10(-4)) and prolonged survival on {TKI} treatment (p=0.019). The multigene assay can classify {ccRCCs} into clinical prognostic subtypes, which may be predictive of response in patients receiving {TKI} therapy.},

However, macrophage infiltration and local biomarkers of inflammation in breast adipose tissue have seldom been studied in association with obesity.

The presence of macrophage-enriched inflammatory loci with immunopositivity for {CD}68 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry ({IHC}). After adjusting for confounding by age, 760 genes were differentially expressed (203 up and 557 down; {FDR} = 0.026) between normal-weight and obese women. Gene ontology analysis suggested significant enrichment for pathways involving {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {CCR}5 signaling in macrophages and {RXRα} and {PPARα} activation, consistent with a pro-inflammatory state and suggestive of macrophage infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis also demonstrated that the genomic signatures of monocytes and macrophages were over-represented in the obese group with {FDR} of 0.08 and 0.13, respectively. Increased macrophage infiltration was confirmed by {IHC}, which showed that the breast adipose tissue of obese women had higher average macrophage counts (mean = 8.96 vs. 3.56 in normal-weight women) and inflammatory foci counts (mean = 4.91 vs. 2.67 in normal-weight women). Obesity is associated with local inflammation and macrophage infiltration in normal human breast adipose tissues.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} Germ-line mutations in the {BRCA}1 tumor suppressor gene predispose to early onset breast cancers with a distinct phenotype characterized by high tumor grade, aneuploidy, high proliferation rate, and estrogen receptor-negativity. The molecular mechanisms and cooperative oncogenes contributing to multistep tumor progression in cells lacking {BRCA}1 are not well defined. To examine whether C-{MYC} ({MYC}), a transforming oncogene associated with genetic instability, contributes to multistep tumor progression in {BRCA}1-associated breast cancer, we have analyzed tumors from women with hereditary {BRCA}1-mutated and sporadic breast cancers. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN} We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization using a {MYC}:{CEP}8 assay on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 40 women with known deleterious germ-line {BRCA}1 mutations and 62 sporadic cases, including 20 cases with hypermethylation of the {BRCA}1 gene promoter. {RESULTS} We observed a {MYC}:{CEP}8 amplification ratio {\textgreater}/=2 in 21 of 40 (53\%) {BRCA}1-mutated tumors compared with 14 of 62 (23\%) sporadic tumors (P = 0.003). Of the 14 sporadic cases with {MYC} amplification, 8 (57\%) were {BRCA}1-methylated. In total, {MYC} amplification was found in a significantly higher proportion of tumors with {BRCA}1 dysfunction (29 of 60, 48\% versus 6 of 42, 14\%; P = 0.0003). In a multivariable regression model controlling for age, tumor size, and estrogen receptor status, {BRCA}1-mutated tumors demonstrated significantly greater mean {MYC}:{CEP}8 ratio than sporadic tumors (P = 0.02). {CONCLUSIONS} Our data indicate that {MYC} oncogene amplification contributes to tumor progression in {BRCA}1-associated breast cancers. Thus, we conclude that the aggressive histopathological features of {BRCA}1-associated tumors are in part due to dysregulated {MYC} activity.},

Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ({CCLE}): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to {IGF}1 receptor inhibitors; {AHR} expression was associated with {MEK} inhibitor efficacy in {NRAS}-mutant lines; and {SLFN}11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents.

	abstract = {{MYC} contributes to the pathogenesis of a majority of human cancers, yet strategies to modulate the function of the c-Myc oncoprotein do not exist. Toward this objective, we have targeted {MYC} transcription by interfering with chromatin-dependent signal transduction to {RNA} polymerase, specifically by inhibiting the acetyl-lysine recognition domains (bromodomains) of putative coactivator proteins implicated in transcriptional initiation and elongation. Using a selective small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor, {JQ}1, we identify {BET} bromodomain proteins as regulatory factors for c-Myc. {BET} inhibition by {JQ}1 downregulates {MYC} transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, {JQ}1 produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Efficacy of {JQ}1 in three murine models of multiple myeloma establishes the therapeutic rationale for {BET} bromodomain inhibition in this disease and other malignancies characterized by pathologic activation of c-Myc.},

This phenomenon of aerobic glycolysis, referred to as the “Warburg effect”, commonly exists in a variety of tumors. Recent studies further demonstrate that both genetic factors such as oncogenes and tumor suppressors and microenvironmental factors such as spatial hypoxia and acidosis can regulate the glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells. Reciprocally, altered cancer cell metabolism can modulate the tumor microenvironment which plays important roles in cancer cell somatic evolution, metastasis, and therapeutic response. In this article, we review the progression of current understandings on the molecular interaction between cancer cell metabolism and the tumor microenvironment.

	abstract = {High-dimensional '-omics' profiling provides a detailed molecular view of individual cancers; however, understanding the mechanisms by which tumors evade cellular defenses requires deep knowledge of the underlying cellular pathways within each cancer sample. We extended the {PARADIGM} algorithm (Vaske et al., 2010, Bioinformatics, 26, i237-i245), a pathway analysis method for combining multiple '-omics' data types, to learn the strength and direction of 9139 gene and protein interactions curated from the literature. Using genomic and {mRNA} expression data from 1936 samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) cohort, we learned interactions that provided support for and relative strength of 7138 (78\%) of the curated links. Gene set enrichment found that genes involved in the strongest interactions were significantly enriched for transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and response to tumor cells. Within the {TCGA} breast cancer cohort, we assessed different interaction strengths between breast cancer subtypes, and found interactions associated with the {MYC} pathway and the {ER} alpha network to be among the most differential between basal and luminal A subtypes. {PARADIGM} with the Naive Bayesian assumption produced gene activity predictions that, when clustered, found groups of patients with better separation in survival than both the original version of {PARADIGM} and a version without the assumption. We found that this Naive Bayes assumption was valid for the vast majority of co-regulators, indicating that most co-regulators act independently on their shared target.

	abstract = {Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular environment by various types of cells, including tumor cells. Exosomes are enriched with a discrete set of cellular proteins, and therefore expected to exert diverse biological functions according to cell origin. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) possess the potential for differentiation into multilineages and can also function as precursors for tumor stroma including myofibroblast that provides a favorable environment for tumor progression. Although a close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a neoplastic tumor microenvironment has already been revealed, how this communication works is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of tumor cell-derived exosomes on {MSCs} by treating adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}) with breast cancer-derived exosomes. The exosome-treated {ADSCs} exhibited the phenotypes of tumor-associated myofibroblasts with increased expression of α-{SMA}. Exosome treatment also induced increased expression of tumor-promoting factors {SDF}-1, {VEGF}, {CCL}5 and {TGFβ}. This phenomenon was correlated with increased expression of {TGFβ} receptor I and {II}. Analysis of {SMAD}2, a key player in the {TGFβ} receptor-mediated {SMAD} pathway, revealed that its phosphorylation was increased by exosome treatment and was inhibited by treatment with {SB}431542, an inhibitor of the {SMAD}-mediated pathway, resulting in decreased expression of α-{SMA}. Taken together, our results show that tumor-derived exosomes induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} via the {SMAD}-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that tumor-derived exosomes can contribute to progression and malignancy of tumor cells by converting {MSCs} within tumor stroma into tumor-associated myofibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.},

However, the molecular characteristics of recurrent ovarian cancers following initial treatment have been poorly estimated. This study was to investigate the pattern of somatic point mutations in matched paired samples of primary and recurrent epithelial ovarian cancers, using the {OncoMap} mutation detection protocol. We have adapted a high-throughput genotyping platform to determine the mutation status of a large panel of known cancer genes. {OncoMap} v.4.4 was used to evaluate genomic {DNA} isolated from a set of 92 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ({FFPE}) tumors, consisting of matched paired samples of initially diagnosed and recurrent tumors from 46 epithelial ovarian cancer ({EOC}) patients. Mutations were observed in 33.7\% of the samples, with 29.3\% of these samples having a single mutation and the remaining 4.3\% having two or more mutations. Among the 41 genes analyzed, 35 mutations were found in four genes, namely, {CDKN}2A (2.2\%), {KRAS} (6.5\%), {MLH}1 (8.2\%) and {TP}53 (20.7\%). {TP}53 was the most frequently mutated gene, but there was no correlation between the presence of mutation in any gene and clinical prognosis. Furthermore, somatic mutations did not differ between primary and recurrent ovarian carcinomas. Every mutation present in recurrent samples was detected in the corresponding primary sample. In conclusion, these {OncoMap} data of Korean {EOC} samples provide that somatic mutations were found in {CDKN}2A, {KRAS}, {MLH}1, and {TP}53. No differences in mutational status between primary and recurrent samples were detected. To understand the biology of tumor recurrence in epithelial ovarian cancer, more studies are necessary, including epigenetic modifications or additional mutations in other genes.},

	abstract = {Large-scale integrated cancer genome characterization efforts including the cancer genome atlas and the cancer cell line encyclopedia have created unprecedented opportunities to study cancer biology in the context of knowing the entire catalog of genetic alterations. A clinically important challenge is to discover cancer subtypes and their molecular drivers in a comprehensive genetic context. Curtis et al. [Nature (2012) 486(7403):346-352] has recently shown that integrative clustering of copy number and gene expression in 2,000 breast tumors reveals novel subgroups beyond the classic expression subtypes that show distinct clinical outcomes. To extend the scope of integrative analysis for the inclusion of somatic mutation data by massively parallel sequencing, we propose a framework for joint modeling of discrete and continuous variables that arise from integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling. The core idea is motivated by the hypothesis that diverse molecular phenotypes can be predicted by a set of orthogonal latent variables that represent distinct molecular drivers, and thus can reveal tumor subgroups of biological and clinical importance. Using the cancer cell line encyclopedia dataset, we demonstrate our method can accurately group cell lines by their cell-of-origin for several cancer types, and precisely pinpoint their known and potential cancer driver genes. Our integrative analysis also demonstrates the power for revealing subgroups that are not lineage-dependent, but consist of different cancer types driven by a common genetic alteration. Application of the cancer genome atlas colorectal cancer data reveals distinct integrated tumor subtypes, suggesting different genetic pathways in colon cancer progression.},

Notably, the interplay via the exchange of exosomes between cancer cells and between cancer cells and the tumor stroma may promote the transfer of oncogenes (e.g. β-catenin, {CEA}, {HER}2, Melan-A/Mart-1 and {LMP}-1) and onco-{microRNAs} (e.g. let7, {miR}1, {miR}15, {miR}16 and {miR}375) from one cell to another, leading to the reprogramming of the recipient cells.

The authors computed age-adjusted rates, as well as age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted rate ratios ({RR}) for ductal and lobular breast cancer and for the use of estrogen only (E-only) and estrogen and progesterone (E + P) for current and former hormone users by duration of use and years since last use. {RESULTS}: Current use of E + P was associated with an increased risk of both ductal ({RR} of 1.75; 95\% confidence interval [95\% {CI}], 1.53-2.01) and lobular ({RR} of 2.12; 95\% {CI}, 1.62-2.77) breast cancer. Risk increased within the first 2 to 3 years of use and attenuated 2 years after cessation. In contrast, current use of E-only was not associated with an overall increased risk of invasive ductal cancer. The only exceptions to this finding were in lean (body mass index {\textless}25) women and for ductal cancers diagnosed at the regional/distant stage, where in both cases the use of E-only was associated with an increased risk. E-only use was associated with a 50\% increased risk of invasive lobular cancer after {\textgreater}or=10 years of use. {CONCLUSIONS}: Use of E + P is more detrimental to the breast than E-only use, in terms of both ductal and lobular cancer. The findings from the current study suggest a window of 2 to 3 years for the risks of E + P both to become apparent after initial use and to attenuate after cessation.},

Tumor-derived microvesicles are heterogeneous membrane-bound sacs that are shed from the surfaces of tumor cells into the extracellular environment. They have been thought to deposit paracrine information and create paths of least resistance, as well as be taken up by cells in the tumor microenvironment to modulate the molecular makeup and behavior of recipient cells. The complexity of their bioactive cargo—which includes proteins, {RNA}, {microRNA}, and {DNA}—suggests multipronged mechanisms by which microvesicles can condition the extracellular milieu to facilitate disease progression. The formation of these shed vesicles likely involves both a redistribution of surface lipids and the vertical trafficking of cargo to sites of microvesicle biogenesis at the cell surface. Current research also suggests that molecular profiling of these structures could unleash their potential as circulating biomarkers as well as platforms for personalized medicine. Thus, new and improved strategies for microvesicle identification, isolation, and capture will have marked implications in point-of-care diagnostics for cancer patients.},

The p53 protein responds to various stress signals by initiating a transcriptional program that restores cellular homeostasis and prevents the accumulation of errors in a cell. As part of this process, p53 regulates the transcription of a set of genes encoding proteins that populate the endosomal compartment and impact upon each of these endosomal functions. Here, we demonstrate that p53 regulates transcription of the genes {TSAP}6 and {CHMP}4C, which enhance exosome production, and {CAV}1 and {CHMP}4C, which produce a more rapid endosomal clearance of the epidermal growth factor receptor from the plasma membrane. Each of these p53-regulated endosomal functions results in the slowing of cell growth and division, the utilization of catabolic resources and cell-to-cell communication by exosomes after a stress signal is detected by the p53 protein. These processes avoid errors during stress and restore homeostasis once the stress is resolved.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States. Numerous gene signatures of patient prognosis have been proposed, but diverse data and methods make these difficult to compare or use in a clinically meaningful way. We sought to identify successful published prognostic gene signatures through systematic validation using public data.
{METHODS}: A systematic review identified 14 prognostic models for late-stage ovarian cancer. For each, we evaluated its 1) reimplementation as described by the original study, 2) performance for prognosis of overall survival in independent data, and 3) performance compared with random gene signatures. We compared and ranked models by validation in 10 published datasets comprising 1251 primarily high-grade, late-stage serous ovarian cancer patients. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: Twelve published models had 95\% confidence intervals of the C-index that did not include the null value of 0.5; eight outperformed 97.5\% of signatures including the same number of randomly selected genes and trained on the same data. The four top-ranked models achieved overall validation C-indices of 0.56 to 0.60 and shared anticorrelation with expression of immune response pathways. Most models demonstrated lower accuracy in new datasets than in validation sets presented in their publication.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This analysis provides definitive support for a handful of prognostic models but also confirms that these require improvement to be of clinical value. This work addresses outstanding controversies in the ovarian cancer literature and provides a reproducible framework for meta-analytic evaluation of gene signatures.},

	abstract = {{DNA} repair competency is one determinant of sensitivity to certain chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin. Cancer cells with intact {DNA} repair can avoid the accumulation of genome damage during growth and also can repair platinum-induced {DNA} damage. We sought genomic signatures indicative of defective {DNA} repair in cell lines and tumors and correlated these signatures to platinum sensitivity. The number of subchromosomal regions with allelic imbalance extending to the telomere (N({tAI})) predicted cisplatin sensitivity in vitro and pathologic response to preoperative cisplatin treatment in patients with triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}). In serous ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, higher levels of N({tAI}) forecast a better initial response. We found an inverse relationship between {BRCA}1 expression and N({tAI}) in sporadic {TNBC} and serous ovarian cancers without {BRCA}1 or {BRCA}2 mutation. Thus, accumulation of telomeric allelic imbalance is a marker of platinum sensitivity and suggests impaired {DNA} repair.},

However, clustering of subjects by diet separated them by the same residence location and microbiota groupings. The separation of microbiota composition significantly correlated with measures of frailty, co-morbidity, nutritional status, markers of inflammation and with metabolites in faecal water. The individual microbiota of people in long-stay care was significantly less diverse than that of community dwellers. Loss of community-associated microbiota correlated with increased frailty. Collectively, the data support a relationship between diet, microbiota and health status, and indicate a role for diet-driven microbiota alterations in varying rates of health decline upon ageing.},

Furthermore, we show that this specific kinase profile is validated using independent sets of human tumors and is also seen in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Kinase expression knockdown studies show that many of these kinases are essential for the growth of {ER}-negative, but not {ER}-positive, breast cancer cell lines. Finally, survival analysis of patients with breast cancer shows that the S6 kinase pathway signature subtype of {ER}-negative cancers confers an extremely poor prognosis, whereas patients whose tumors express high levels of immunomodulatory kinases have a significantly better prognosis. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study identifies a list of kinases that are prognostic and may serve as druggable targets for the treatment of {ER}-negative breast cancer.},

We extended the {PARADIGM} algorithm (Vaske et al., 2010, Bioinformatics, 26, i237–i245), a pathway analysis method for combining multiple ‘-omics’ data types, to learn the strength and direction of 9139 gene and protein interactions curated from the literature. Using genomic and {mRNA} expression data from 1936 samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) cohort, we learned interactions that provided support for and relative strength of 7138 (78\%) of the curated links. Gene set enrichment found that genes involved in the strongest interactions were significantly enriched for transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and response to tumor cells. Within the {TCGA} breast cancer cohort, we assessed different interaction strengths between breast cancer subtypes, and found interactions associated with the {MYC} pathway and the {ER} alpha network to be among the most differential between basal and luminal A subtypes. {PARADIGM} with the Naive Bayesian assumption produced gene activity predictions that, when clustered, found groups of patients with better separation in survival than both the original version of {PARADIGM} and a version without the assumption. We found that this Naive Bayes assumption was valid for the vast majority of co-regulators, indicating that most co-regulators act independently on their shared target., Availability:

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis ({MCIA}), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, {MCIA} simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using {MCIA}, applied to two typical "omics" research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the {NCI}-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation {RNA}-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of {RNA}-sequencing data processed using {RPKM} had greater variance than that with {MapSplice} and {RSEM}. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. {MCIA} is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor "omicade4" package.
{CONCLUSION}: We believe {MCIA} is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. {MCIA} provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

	shorttitle = {Embryonic stem cell {microRNAs}},
	abstract = {The discovery of {microRNAs} ({miRNAs} - small non-coding {RNAs} of approximately 22 nt) heralded a new and exciting era in biology. During this period {miRNAs} have gone from ignominy due to their origin mainly in 'junk {DNA}' to notoriety where they can be at once characterized as being all powerful (a single {miRNA} can target and potentially silence several hundred genes) and yet marginal (a given gene can be targeted by several {miRNAs} such that a given {miRNA} typically exerts a modest repression) [1-4]. The emerging paradox is exemplified by {miRNAs} that are prominently expressed in embryonic stem ({ES}) cells. The collective importance of {miRNAs} is firmly established by the fact that Dicer-/- mouse embryos die on day 7.5 due to defects in differentiation [5]. However, oppositely correlated expression that is expected of conventional repressors is increasingly being defied in multiple systems in relation to {miRNA}-{mRNA} target pairs. This is most evident in {ES} cells where {miR}-290-295 and 302 clusters the most abundant {ES} cell {miRNAs} are found to be driven by pluripotency genes Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 and also target these genes in 'incoherent feed-forward loops' [7]. Here the {miRNAs} are co-expressed and positively correlated with these targets that they repress suggesting that one of their primary roles is to fine tune gene expression rather than act as {ON}/{OFF} switches. On the other hand, let-7 family members that are notably low in {ES} cells and rapidly induced upon differentiation exhibit more conventional anti-correlated expression patterns with their targets [7-8]. In an intricately designed auto-regulatory loop, {LIN}28, a key 'keeper' of the pluripotent state binds and represses the processing of let-7 (a key 'keeper' of the differentiated state) [9-11]. One of the let-7 family members, let-7g targets and represses {LIN}28 through four 3'-{UTR} binding sites [12]. We propose that {LIN}28/let-7 pair has the potential to act as a 'toggle switch' that balances the decision to maintain pluripotency vs. differentiation. We also propose that the c-Myc/E2F driven {miR}17-92 cluster that together controls the G1 to S transition is fundamental for {ES} self-renewal and cell proliferation [13-18]. In that context it is no surprise that {LIN}28 and c-Myc (and therefore let-7 and {miR}-17-92 by association) and more recently Oct4/Sox2 regulated {miR}-302 has been shown to be among a handful of factors shown to be necessary and sufficient to convert differentiated cells to induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cells [19-29]. It is also no surprise that activation of {miR}-17-92 ({OncomiRs}) and down-regulation of let-7 (tumor suppressors) is a recurring theme in relation to cancers from multiple systems [30-48]. We speculate that the {LIN}28/let-7; c-{MYC}-E2F/{miR}-17-92 and Oct4/Sox2/{miR}-302-cyclin D1 networks are fundamental to properties of pluripotency and self-renewal associated with embryonic stem cells. We also speculate that {ES} cell {miRNA}-{mRNA} associations may also regulate tissue homeostasis and regeneration in the fully developed adult. Consequently, the appropriate regulation of {LIN}28/let-7; c-{MYC}-E2F/{miR}-17-92 and Oct4/Sox2/{miR}-302-cyclin D1 gene networks will be critical for the success of regenerative strategies that involve {iPS} cells. Any perturbation in key {ES} cell {miRNA}-{mRNA} networks during any of the above processes maybe a hallmark of ({CSCs}).},

Functional annotation of differentially regulated genes revealed 3 major networks related to cell cycle, cell-to-cell interactions and cellular development. The prognostic impact of 8 genes, representative of these 3 networks, was validated in 56 {EWS} patients. High {mRNA} expression levels of {HINT}1, {IFITM}2, {LGALS}3BP, {STOML}2 and c-{MYC} were associated with reduced risk to death and lower risk to develop metastasis. At multivariate analysis, {LGALS}3BP, a matricellular protein with a role in tumor progression and metastasis, was the most important predictor of event-free survival and overall survival. The association between {LGALS}3BP and prognosis was confirmed at protein level, when expression of the molecule was determined in tumor tissues but not in serum, indicating a role for the protein at local tumor microenvironment. Engineered enhancement of {LGALS}3BP expression in {EWS} cells resulted in inhibition of anchorage independent cell growth and reduction of cell migration and metastasis. Silencing of {LGALS}3BP expression reverted cell behavior with respect to in vitro parameters, thus providing further functional validation of genetic data obtained in clinical samples. Thus, we propose {LGALS}3BP as a novel reliable indicator of prognosis, and we offer genetic signatures to the scientific communities for cross-validation and meta-analysis, which are indispensable tools for a rare tumor such as {EWS}.},

We analyzed somatic {DNA} copy number variation and gene expression data to identify key mechanisms associated with primary resistance in advanced-stage serous cancers. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN} Genome-wide copy number variation was measured in 118 ovarian tumors using high-resolution oligonucleotide microarrays. A well-defined subset of 85 advanced-stage serous tumors was then used to relate copy number variation to primary resistance to treatment. The discovery-based approach was complemented by quantitative-{PCR} copy number analysis of 12 candidate genes as independent validation of previously reported associations with clinical outcome. Likely copy number variation targets and tumor molecular subtypes were further characterized by gene expression profiling. {RESULTS} Amplification of 19q12, containing cyclin E ({CCNE}1), and 20q11.22-q13.12, mapping immediately adjacent to the steroid receptor coactivator {NCOA}3, was significantly associated with poor response to primary treatment. Other genes previously associated with copy number variation and clinical outcome in ovarian cancer were not associated with primary treatment resistance. Chemoresistant tumors with high {CCNE}1 copy number and protein expression were associated with increased cellular proliferation but so too was a subset of treatment-responsive patients, suggesting a cell-cycle independent role for {CCNE}1 in modulating chemoresponse. Patients with a poor clinical outcome without {CCNE}1 amplification overexpressed genes involved in extracellular matrix deposition. {CONCLUSIONS} We have identified two distinct mechanisms of primary treatment failure in serous ovarian cancer, involving {CCNE}1 amplification and enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. {CCNE}1 copy number is validated as a dominant marker of patient outcome in ovarian cancer.},

The purpose of this study was to determine if changes in telomere length occur in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma ({STIC}), the putative precursor of "ovarian" high-grade serous carcinoma ({HGSC}). Twenty-two {STICs} from 15 patients with concurrent but discrete {HGSCs} were analyzed for telomere length on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections by conducting p53 immunofluorescence to assist in identifying {STICs} and telomere-specific {FISH}. Telomere length (short, long, or no change) in {STICs} was compared with {HGSCs} using normal fallopian tube epithelium and stromal cells as controls. We found that {STICs} had the shortest telomeres, as 18 (82\%) of 22 {STICs} had short telomeres, whereas only 2 (9\%) showed no change and 2 (9\%) had long telomeres compared with the normal-looking tubal epithelium. In contrast, among 12 paired {HGSCs} and {STICs}, 6 {HGSCs} showed an increase in telomere length, one showed a decrease in length and 5 did not show any change when compared with their matched {STICs}, although, such as {STICs}, the majority of {HGSCs} had shorter telomeres than the associated normal tubal epithelial cells. These differences in telomere length between normal tubal epithelial cells and {STICs}, and between {STICs} and {HGSCs} were statisticaly significant (P{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, the finding of short telomeres, which have been shown to be one of the earliest molecular changes in carcinogenesis, in a vast majority of {STICs} provides further support to the proposal that {STICs} are precursors of {HGSC} and opens new areas of research in elucidating the early events of ovarian high-grade serous carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Background
{DNA} triplexes can naturally occur, co-localize and interact with many other regulatory {DNA} elements (e.g. G-quadruplex (G4) {DNA} motifs), specific {DNA}-binding proteins (e.g. transcription factors ({TFs})), and micro-{RNA} ({miRNA}) precursors. Specific genome localizations of triplex target {DNA} sites ({TTSs}) may cause abnormalities in a double-helix {DNA} structure and can be directly involved in some human diseases. However, genome localization of specific {TTSs}, their interconnection with regulatory {DNA} elements and physiological roles in a cell are poor defined. Therefore, it is important to identify comprehensive and reliable catalogue of specific potential {TTSs} ({pTTSs}) and their co-localization patterns with other regulatory {DNA} elements in the human genome.

Results
"{TTS} mapping" database is a web-based search engine developed here, which is aimed to find and annotate {pTTSs} within a region of interest of the human genome. The engine provides descriptive statistics of {pTTSs} in a given region and its sequence context. Different annotation tracks of {TTS}-overlapping gene region(s), G4 motifs, {CpG} Island, {miRNA} precursors, {miRNA} targets, transcription factor binding sites ({TFBSs}), Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ({SNPs}), small nucleolar {RNAs} ({snoRNA}), and repeat elements are also mapped based onto a sequence location provided by {UCSC} genome browser, G4 database http://www.quadruplex.org and several other datasets. The results pages provide links to {UCSC} genome browser annotation tracks and relative {DBs}. {BLASTN} program was included to check the uniqueness of a given {pTTS} in the human genome. Recombination- and mutation-prone genes (e.g. {EVI}-1, {MYC}) were found to be significantly enriched by {TTSs} and multiple co-occurring with our regulatory {DNA} elements. {TTS} mapping reveals that a high-complementary and evolutionarily conserved polypurine and polypyrimidine {DNA} sequence pair linked by a non-conserved short {DNA} sequence can form {miR}-483 transcribed from intron 2 of {IGF}2 gene and bound double-strand nucleic acid {TTSs} forming natural triplex structures.

Conclusion
{TTS} mapping provides comprehensive visual and analytical tools to help users to find {pTTSs}, G-quadruplets and other regulatory {DNA} elements in various genome regions. {TTS} Mapping not only provides sequence visualization and statistical information, but also integrates knowledge about co-localization {TTS} with various {DNA} elements and facilitates that data analysis. In particular, {TTS} Mapping reveals complex structural-functional regulatory module of gene {IGF}2 including {TF} {MZF}1 binding site and {ncRNA} precursor mir-483 formed by the high-complementary and evolutionarily conserved polypurine- and polypyrimidine-rich {DNA} pair. Such {ncRNAs} capable of forming helical triplex structures with a polypurine strand of a nucleic acid duplexes ({DNA} or {RNA}) via Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds.  Our web tool could be used to discover biologically meaningful genome modules and to optimize experimental design of anti-gene treatment.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is known to show considerable inter-tumoural heterogeneity. It is widely accepted that combinations of oncogenic events have a major role in determining tumour phenotype. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the identity of the cell that acquires the first oncogenic event, the so-called cell of origin, may define the molecular subtype of the resulting tumour. Recent work published in the Journal of Pathology by Natrajan and colleagues questions the origin of breast cancer heterogeneity. After studying {BRCA}1 tumours, they suggest that genomic alterations are not sufficient to determine tumour behaviour. These and other recent observations underscore the importance of defining what is causing tumour heterogeneity, so that appropriate therapy can be given.

We hypothesized that mutational inactivation of the tumor-suppressor gene {TP}53 and genomic alterations in stromal cells of a tumor's microenvironment contribute to the clinical outcome. {METHODS} We performed {TP}53 mutation analysis and genomewide analysis of loss of heterozygosity and allelic imbalance on {DNA} from isolated neoplastic epithelial and stromal cells from 43 patients with hereditary breast cancer and 175 patients with sporadic breast cancer. Compartment-specific patterns and {TP}53 mutations were analyzed. Associations between compartment-specific {TP}53 status, loss of heterozygosity or allelic imbalance, and clinical and pathological characteristics were computed. {RESULTS} {TP}53 mutations were associated with an increased loss of heterozygosity and allelic imbalance in both hereditary and sporadic breast cancers, but samples from patients with hereditary disease had more frequent mutations than did those from patients with sporadic tumors (74.4\% vs. 42.3\%, P=0.001). Only 1 microsatellite locus (2p25.1) in stromal cells from hereditary breast cancers was associated with mutated {TP}53, whereas there were 66 such loci in cells from sporadic breast cancers. Somatic {TP}53 mutations in stroma, but not epithelium, of sporadic breast cancers were associated with regional nodal metastases (P=0.003). A specific set of five loci linked to an increased loss of heterozygosity and allelic imbalance in the stroma of sporadic tumors was associated with nodal metastases in the absence of {TP}53 mutations. No associations were found between any of the clinical or pathological features of hereditary breast cancer with somatic {TP}53 mutations. {CONCLUSIONS} Stroma-specific loss of heterozygosity or allelic imbalance is associated with somatic {TP}53 mutations and regional lymph-node metastases in sporadic breast cancer but not in hereditary breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Transformation of normal cells into malignant tumors requires the acquisition of six hallmark traits, e.g., self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals and self-renewal, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replication potential, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, which are common to all cancers (Hanahan and Weinberg 2000). These new cellular traits evolve from defects in major regulatory microcircuits that are fundamental for normal homeostasis. The discovery of {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) as a new class of small non-protein-coding {RNAs} that control gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to various {mRNA} targets suggests that these tiny {RNA} molecules likely act as molecular switches in the extensive regulatory web that involves thousands of transcripts. Most importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that numerous {microRNAs} are aberrantly expressed in human cancers. In this review, we discuss the emergent roles of {microRNAs} as switches that function to turn on/off known cellular microcircuits. We outline recent compelling evidence that deregulated {microRNA}-mediated control of cellular microcircuits cooperates with other well-established regulatory mechanisms to confer the hallmark traits of the cancer cell. Furthermore, these exciting insights into aberrant {microRNA} control in cancer-associated circuits may be exploited for cancer therapies that will target deregulated {miRNA} switches.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are nanosized (30-100 nm) membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosomes have been found to contain various {RNA} species including {miRNA}, {mRNA} and long non-protein coding {RNAs}. A number of cancer cells produce elevated levels of exosomes. Because exosomes have been isolated from most body fluids they may provide a source for non-invasive cancer diagnostics. Transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies ({RNA}-Seq) offers enormous amount of data that can be used for biomarkers discovery, however, in case of exosomes this approach was applied only for the analysis of small {RNAs}. In this study, we utilized {RNA}-Seq technology to analyze {RNAs} present in microvesicles secreted by human breast cancer cell lines. Exosomes were isolated from the media conditioned by two human breast cancer cell lines, {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {MDA}-{MB}-436. Exosomal {RNA} was profiled using the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based technology. Exosomes were found to contain various classes of {RNA} with the major class represented by fragmented ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}), in particular 28S and 18S {rRNA} subunits. Analysis of exosomal {RNA} content revealed that it reflects {RNA} content of the donor cells. Although exosomes produced by the two cancer cell lines shared most of the {RNA} species, there was a number of non-coding transcripts unique to {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {MDA}-{MB}-436 cells. This suggests that {RNA} analysis might distinguish exosomes produced by low metastatic breast cancer cell line ({MDA}-{MB}-436) from that produced by highly metastatic breast cancer cell line ({MDA}-{MB}-231). The analysis of gene ontologies ({GOs}) associated with the most abundant transcripts present in exosomes revealed significant enrichment in genes encoding proteins involved in translation and {rRNA} and {ncRNA} processing. These {GO} terms indicate most expressed genes for both, cellular and exosomal {RNA}. For the first time, using {RNA}-seq, we examined the transcriptomes of exosomes secreted by human breast cancer cells. We found that most abundant exosomal {RNA} species are the fragments of 28S and 18S {rRNA} subunits. This limits the number of reads from other {RNAs}. To increase the number of detectable transcripts and improve the accuracy of their expression level the protocols allowing depletion of fragmented {rRNA} should be utilized in the future {RNA}-seq analyses on exosomes. Present data revealed that exosomal transcripts are representative of their cells of origin and thus could form basis for detection of tumor specific markers.},

The presence of macrophage-enriched inflammatory loci with immunopositivity for {CD}68 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry ({IHC}). After adjusting for confounding by age, 760 genes were differentially expressed (203 up and 557 down; {FDR} = 0.026) between normal-weight and obese women. Gene ontology analysis suggested significant enrichment for pathways involving {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {CCR}5 signaling in macrophages and {RXRα} and {PPARα} activation, consistent with a pro-inflammatory state and suggestive of macrophage infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis also demonstrated that the genomic signatures of monocytes and macrophages were over-represented in the obese group with {FDR} of 0.08 and 0.13, respectively. Increased macrophage infiltration was confirmed by {IHC}, which showed that the breast adipose tissue of obese women had higher average macrophage counts (mean = 8.96 vs. 3.56 in normal-weight women) and inflammatory foci counts (mean = 4.91 vs. 2.67 in normal-weight women). Obesity is associated with local inflammation and macrophage infiltration in normal human breast adipose tissues.

Exosomes are small membrane vesicles with an endosome origin that are released by cells into the extracellular environment. They carry a cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and transfer their cargo to recipient cells and altering the recipient cells' biochemical composition, signaling pathways, and gene regulation. Exosomes can thus serve as extracellular messengers mediating cell-cell communication. Both cancer cells and stromal cells release exosomes not only into the cancer microenvironment but also into the circulation.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: With the rapid development of new genetic measurement methods, several types of genetic alterations can be quantified in a high-throughput manner. While the initial focus has been on investigating each data set separately, there is an increasing interest in studying the correlation structure between two or more data sets. Multivariate methods based on Canonical Correlation Analysis ({CCA}) have been proposed for integrating paired genetic data sets. The high dimensionality of microarray data imposes computational difficulties, which have been addressed for instance by studying the covariance structure of the data, or by reducing the number of variables prior to applying the {CCA}. In this work, we propose a new method for analyzing high-dimensional paired genetic data sets, which mainly emphasizes the correlation structure and still permits efficient application to very large data sets. The method is implemented by translating a regularized {CCA} to its dual form, where the computational complexity depends mainly on the number of samples instead of the number of variables. The optimal regularization parameters are chosen by cross-validation. We apply the regularized dual {CCA}, as well as a classical {CCA} preceded by a dimension-reducing Principal Components Analysis ({PCA}), to a paired data set of gene expression changes and copy number alterations in leukemia.
{RESULTS}: Using the correlation-maximizing methods, regularized dual {CCA} and {PCA}+{CCA}, we show that without pre-selection of known disease-relevant genes, and without using information about clinical class membership, an exploratory analysis singles out two patient groups, corresponding to well-known leukemia subtypes. Furthermore, the variables showing the highest relevance to the extracted features agree with previous biological knowledge concerning copy number alterations and gene expression changes in these subtypes. Finally, the correlation-maximizing methods are shown to yield results which are more biologically interpretable than those resulting from a covariance-maximizing method, and provide different insight compared to when each variable set is studied separately using {PCA}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We conclude that regularized dual {CCA} as well as {PCA}+{CCA} are useful methods for exploratory analysis of paired genetic data sets, and can be efficiently implemented also when the number of variables is very large.},

Most of the methods ranked high the gene sets designed for specific diseases whenever samples from affected individuals were compared against controls via microarrays. The top methods for gene set prioritization were different from the top ones in terms of sensitivity, and four of the sixteen methods had large false positives rates assessed by permuting the phenotype of the samples.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Microparticles are cellular-derived vesicles (0.5-1.0 μm) composed of cell membrane components, which are actively shed from the surface of various cells, including epithelial cells. We compared microparticles in ascites between women with ovarian carcinoma and women with benign ovarian pathology, and isolated tumor-derived (epithelial cell adhesion molecule [{EpCAM}]-positive) microparticles for functional analysis and proteomics.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Cases included 8 patients with benign ovarian neoplasms and 41 with ovarian carcinoma. Ascites from a high-grade stage {III} serous carcinoma was used for functional and proteomic analysis. Cancer cells were isolated using {EpCAM}-coated beads, microparticles were isolated by ultracentrifugation/flow cytometry, and sorting was achieved using markers (eg, {EpCAM}). Binding and migrations assays were performed with 3 ovarian cancer cell lines. Proteomic analysis of {EpCAM}-positive microparticles and ascites cancer cells was performed by mass spectrometry.
{RESULTS}: Microparticles in benign pelvic fluid were similar to early and advanced-stage ascites (2.4 vs 2.8 vs 2.0 × 10⁶ microparticles/{mL}). Advanced stage had a greater proportion of {EpCAM}-positive microparticles than early or benign disease (13.3\% vs 2.5\% vs 2.1\%; P = 0.001), and serous histology had more than endometrioid (13.2\% vs 1.8\%; P = 0.01). Microparticles bound to the surface of 3 cultured cell lines, and were internalized into the {EpCAM}-positive microparticles, resulting in more cell migration than buffer alone or {EpCAM}-negative microparticles (P = 0.007). A dose-dependent increase was seen with increasing numbers of {EpCAM}-positive microparticles. Proteomics revealed that most proteins in {EPCAM}-positive microparticles were shared with cancer cells, and many are associated with cell motility and invasion, such as fibronectin, filamin A, vimentin, myosin-9, and fibrinogen.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Ascites from advanced-stage and serous ovarian carcinomas contain large numbers of tumor-derived microparticles. In vitro, these microparticles bind to cancer cells and stimulate migration. Tumor-derived microparticles in ascites could mediate the predilection for peritoneal spread in serous ovarian carcinomas.},

We used real-time {RT}-{PCR} to detect the expression levels of {CCL}5 and its receptors {CCR}5, {CCR}1 and {CCR}3 in 36 breast cancer specimens of different {TNM} stage and their corresponding normal breast tissue. {CCL}5 expression and invasive ability of four human breast cancer cell lines {MCF}-7, {SK}-{BR}-3, T-47D and {MDA}-{MB}-231 were analyzed by real-time {RT}-{PCR} and cell invasion assay, respectively. Effects of recombinant human {CCL}5 ({rhCCL}5) on cell proliferation and percentage of the {CD}44+/{CD}24- subpopulation in {MCF}-7 cells were analyzed respectively by {MTT} assay and flow cytometry. We also used cell invasion assay to detect the invasive ability of both {CD}44+/{CD}24- and {CD}44+/{CD}24+ subpopulations of {MCF}-7 cells treated with {rhCCL}5 and/or {CCR}5 monoclonal antibody. Our results revealed that {CCL}5 and {CCR}5 expression were higher in breast cancer tissue than those in their corresponding normal tissue and breast cancer tissue with higher {TNM} stage contained more {CCL}5 {mRNA}. In addition, {CCR}5 expression and invasive ability of {CD}44+/{CD}24- subpopulation were higher than those of {CD}44+/{CD}24+ subpopulation of {MCF}-7 cells. Moreover, treatment of {rhCCL}5 increased the proportion of {CD}44+/{CD}24- cells and the proliferation of {MCF}-7 cells. Induction of {rhCCL}5 increased the cell invasive ability of both {CD}44+/{CD}24- and {CD}44+/{CD}24+ cells, which could be partially antagonized by {CCR}5 monoclonal antibody. Collectively, our data show that {CCL}5 increased the proportion of {CD}44+/{CD}24- subpopulation and induced invasion and proliferation of {MCF}-7 cells, and expression of {CCL}5 and {CCR}5 in breast cancer tissue was positively correlated with breast cancer progression.},

Reformulating this multilinear {HOSVD} such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this {HOSVD} with an integration of genome-scale {mRNA} expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Neuroendocrine carcinoma ({NEC}) of the breast, a pathologic entity newly defined in the 2003 World Health Organization classification of tumors, is a rare type of tumor that is not well recognized or studied. The purpose of this first case-controlled study is to reveal the clinicopathologic features, therapeutic response, and outcomes of patients with {NEC} of the breast.


{METHODS}

Seventy-four patients with {NEC} of the breast who were treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were analyzed; 68 of them had complete clinical follow-up. Two cohorts of invasive mammary carcinoma cases were selected to pair with {NEC} to reveal demographic, pathologic, and clinical features at presentation, along with therapeutic response to treatment and patient outcomes.


{RESULTS}

{NEC} was more likely to be estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative. Despite similar age and disease stages at presentation, {NEC} showed a more aggressive course than invasive ductal carcinoma, with a higher propensity for local and distant recurrence and poorer overall survival. High nuclear grade, large tumor size, and regional lymph node metastasis were significant negative prognostic factors for distant recurrence-free survival; high nuclear grade and regional lymph node metastasis were also significant negative prognostic factors for overall survival. Although endocrine therapy and radiation therapy showed a trend toward improved survival, the small number of cases in this study limited the statistical power to reveal therapeutic benefits in {NEC} of the breast.


{CONCLUSIONS}

{NEC} is a distinct type of aggressive mammary carcinoma. Novel therapeutic approaches should be explored for this uniquely different clinical entity.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}

High-throughput data is providing a comprehensive view of the molecular changes in cancer tissues. New technologies allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of the state of genome copy number variation, gene expression, {DNA} methylation and epigenetics of tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Analyses of current data sets find that genetic alterations between patients can differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect how they are altered in different patients.


{RESULTS}

We present a novel method for inferring patient-specific genetic activities incorporating curated pathway interactions among genes. A gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected variables encoding the expression and known activity of a gene and its products, allowing the incorporation of many types of omic data as evidence. The method predicts the degree to which a pathway's activities (e.g. internal gene states, interactions or high-level 'outputs') are altered in the patient using probabilistic inference. Compared with a competing pathway activity inference approach called {SPIA}, our method identifies altered activities in cancer-related pathways with fewer false-positives in both a glioblastoma multiform ({GBM}) and a breast cancer dataset. {PARADIGM} identified consistent pathway-level activities for subsets of the {GBM} patients that are overlooked when genes are considered in isolation. Further, grouping {GBM} patients based on their significant pathway perturbations divides them into clinically-relevant subgroups having significantly different survival outcomes. These findings suggest that therapeutics might be chosen that target genes at critical points in the commonly perturbed pathway(s) of a group of patients.

	abstract = {High-grade serous ovarian cancer({HG}-{SOC}), a major histologic type of epithelial ovarian cancer({EOC}), is a poorly-characterized, heterogeneous and lethal disease where somatic mutations of {TP}53 are common and inherited loss-of-function mutations in {BRCA}1/2 predispose to cancer in 9.5-13\% of {EOC} patients. However, the overall burden of disease due to either inherited or sporadic mutations is not known.   We performed bioinformatics analyses of mutational and clinical data of 334 {HG}-{SOC} tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify novel tumor-driving mutations, survival-significant patient subgroups and tumor subtypes potentially driven by either hereditary or sporadic factors. We identified a sub-cluster of high-frequency mutations in 22 patients and 58 genes associated with {DNA} damage repair, apoptosis and cell cycle. Mutations of {CHEK}2, observed with the highest intensity, were associated with poor therapy response and overall survival({OS}) of these patients(P = 8.00e-05), possibly due to detrimental effect of mutations at the nuclear localization signal. A 21-gene mutational prognostic signature significantly stratifies patients into low or relatively high-risk subgroups with 5-y {OS} of 37\% or 6\%, respectively (P = 7.31e-08). Further analysis of these genes and high-risk subgroups revealed 2 distinct classes of tumors characterized by either germline mutations of genes such as {CHEK}2, {RPS}6KA2 and {MLL}4, or somatic mutations of other genes in the signature. Our results could provide improvement in prediction and clinical management of {HG}-{SOC}, facilitate our understanding of this complex disease, guide the design of targeted therapeutics and improve screening efforts to identify women at high-risk of hereditary ovarian cancers distinct from those associated with {BRCA}1/2 mutations.},

Patient outcomes, especially for those in whom chemotherapy is not effective or is poorly tolerated, remain poor. One hallmark of {UBC} is the presence of high rates of somatic mutations. These alterations may enhance the ability of the host immune system to recognize tumour cells as foreign owing to an increased number of antigens. However, these cancers may also elude immune surveillance and eradication through the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 ({PD}-L1; also called {CD}274 or B7-H1) in the tumour microenvironment.

Because {PD}-L1 is expressed on activated T cells, {MPDL}3280A was engineered with a modification in the Fc domain that eliminates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at clinically relevant doses to prevent the depletion of T cells expressing {PD}-L1. Here we show that {MPDL}3280A has noteworthy activity in metastatic {UBC}. Responses were often rapid, with many occurring at the time of the first response assessment (6 weeks) and nearly all were ongoing at the data cutoff. This phase I expansion study, with an adaptive design that allowed for biomarker-positive enriched cohorts, demonstrated that tumours expressing {PD}-L1-positive tumour-infiltrating immune cells had particularly high response rates. Moreover, owing to the favourable toxicity profile, including a lack of renal toxicity, patients with {UBC}, who are often older and have a higher incidence of renal impairment, may be better able to tolerate {MPDL}3280A versus chemotherapy. These results suggest that {MPDL}3280A may have an important role in treating {UBC}—the drug received breakthrough designation status by the {US} Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) in June 2014.},

	abstract = {Heart failure ({HF}) is a syndrome that involves multiple cellular mechanisms leading to a common phenotype of reduced ventricular contraction and cardiac chamber dilation. To clarify the mechanisms, a number of microarray analyses of the failing myocardium have been conducted. Gene expression profiles are usually compared between opposing pairs of samples, such as non-failing vs failing hearts, ischemic vs non-ischemic hearts, male vs female failing hearts or atria vs ventricles of failing hearts. Apart from these conventional methods, a different novel approach identified cardiac myosin light chain kinase ({MLCK}) as a {HF}-related gene by the comprehensive search for the genes that had an expression level that strongly correlated with the severity of {HF}; further investigations proved the important role of cardiac {MLCK} in {HF}. Moreover, a robust gene expression signature composed of 27 genes was revealed on analysis of 4 independent microarray data sets from the failing myocardium of dilated cardiomyopathy. The authors newly demonstrate 107 {HF}-related genes that were listed in 2 or more of 7 microarray data sets previously reported. Among these genes, many were observed to be involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation and 3 extracellular molecules, including periostin, pleiotrophin, and {SERPINA}3, which might become novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for {HF}. These novel strategies warrant the new identification of specific genes that are linked to the pathophysiology of {HF}.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women across the world. The last few decades have seen significant reduction in mortality owing to earlier detection and better adjuvant treatments that were developed based on clinical staging and morphological features. As these treatments have evolved, the heterogeneity of breast cancer poses a new challenge, since there is no standard gold-therapy suitable for all tumors of the mammary gland. Therefore, contemporary management and research efforts are directed toward specific prognostic and predictive molecular signatures that can guide targeted individualized therapy. The goal of ongoing research in this field is to identify specific molecular targets for developing novel therapeutic approaches. These targets can also serve to improve screening of breast cancer. This review focuses on the role of cancer testis antigens ({CTAs}) in breast carcinogenesis and explores the potential for development of targeted screening and therapeutic approaches. Normally found in the testes, these antigens are highly correlative with cancers of the breast, skin, and ovaries. These implications have been further corroborated through uncovering the interaction of {CTAs} with genes and proteins involved in tumor suppression and homeostasis like p53. There is some evidence that these genes can be targeted for early detection in addition to being candidates for cancer immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the main cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Microvesicles ({MVs}) are fragments of the plasma membrane secreted from cytoplasmic membrane compartments by normal and malignant cells. An increase in {MV} number has been found in peripheral blood of patients with several diseases including cancer. We hypothesized that {MV} number and the relative amount of focal adhesion kinase ({FAK}) and epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) proteins in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} are related to the presence of breast cancer.
Methods
Plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} were obtained by differential centrifugation of blood samples. {MV} number was evaluated by {BD} {TruCOUNT} Tubes ({BD} Biosciences). {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins were analyzed by Western blot.
Results
{MV} number in plasma fractions enriched with {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} is higher in breast cancer patients with stages I–{IV} as well as with T2–T4 tumors, in comparison to control group. In addition, plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} present {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins and their amount is increased in some stages of breast cancer in comparison to control group.
Conclusions
Our findings strongly suggest that {MV} number and the amount of {FAK} and {EGFR} in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} are associated with some stages of breast cancer.},

This vast repository is still underutilized due to the lack of methods for fast, accurate exploration of the entire compendium. {RESULTS}: We have collected Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression microarray data containing roughly 2400 experimental conditions. We analyzed the functional coverage of this collection and we designed a context-sensitive search algorithm for rapid exploration of the compendium. A researcher using our system provides a small set of query genes to establish a biological search context; based on this query, we weight each dataset’s relevance to the context, and within these weighted datasets we identify additional genes that are co-expressed with the query set. Our method exhibits an average increase in accuracy of 273\% compared to previous mega-clustering approaches when recapitulating known biology. Further, we find that our search paradigm identifies novel biological predictions that can be verified through further experimentation. Our methodology provides the ability for biological researchers to explore the totality of existing microarray data in a manner useful for drawing conclusions and formulating hypotheses, which we believe is invaluable for the research community. {AVAILABILITY}: Our query-driven search engine, called {SPELL}, is available at http://function.princeton.edu/{SPELL}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Several additional data files, figures and discussions are available at http://function.princeton.edu/{SPELL}/supplement.},

Main objective of the present study is to investigate {miR}-26a and {miR}-101 levels, which both target {EZH}2, for their association with molecular pathways and with efficacy of tamoxifen as first-line monotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. Expression levels were measured using quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ({qRT}-{PCR}) in primary breast cancer specimens of 235 estrogen receptor-α ({ER})-positive patients. Pathway analysis was performed on microarray data available for 65 of these tumors. Logistic regression and Cox uni- and multivariate analysis were performed to relate expression levels with clinical benefit and time to progression ({TTP}). Increasing levels of {miR}-26a were significantly (P {\textless} 0.005) associated with both clinical benefit and prolonged {TTP}, whereas {miR}-101 was not. Cell cycle regulation and {CCNE}1 and {CDC}2 were the only significant overlapping pathway and genes differentially expressed between tumors with high and low levels of {miR}-26a and {EZH}2, respectively. In addition, increasing {mRNA} levels of {CCNE}1 (P {\textless} 0.05) and {CDC}2 (P {\textless} 0.001) were related to poor outcome. Multivariate analysis revealed {miR}-26a and {CDC}2 as an optimal set of markers associated with outcome on tamoxifen therapy, independently of traditional predictive factors. To summarize, only {miR}-26a levels are related with treatment outcome. Cell cycle regulation is the only overlapping pathway linked to {miR}-26a and {EZH}2 levels. Low {mRNA} levels of {EZH}2, {CCNE}1, and {CDC}2, and high levels of {miR}-26a are associated with favorable outcome on tamoxifen.},

We showed that the presence of {PD}-1(+) {TILs} significantly varied among cancer types (from 0\% in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas to 93\% in ovarian cancer), and was generally associated with the increased number of mutations in tumor cells (P = 0.029). Cancer cell expression of {PD}-L1 varied from absent (in Merkel cell carcinomas) to 100\% (in chondro- and liposarcomas), but showed the inverse association with the number of detected mutations (P = 0.004). Both {PD}-1 and {PD}-L1 expression were significantly higher in triple-negative breast cancers ({TNBC}) than in non-{TNBC} (P {\textless} 0.001 and 0.017, respectively).

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Tremendous amount of omics data being accumulated poses a pressing challenge of meta-analyzing the heterogeneous data for mining new biological knowledge. Most existing methods deal with each gene independently, thus often resulting in high false positive rates in detecting differentially expressed genes ({DEG}). To our knowledge, no or little effort has been devoted to methods that consider dependence structures underlying transcriptomics data for {DEG} identification in meta-analysis context.
{RESULTS}: This article proposes a new meta-analysis method for identification of {DEGs} based on joint non-negative matrix factorization ({jNMFMA}). We mathematically extend non-negative matrix factorization ({NMF}) to a joint version ({jNMF}), which is used to simultaneously decompose multiple transcriptomics data matrices into one common submatrix plus multiple individual submatrices. By the {jNMF}, the dependence structures underlying transcriptomics data can be interrogated and utilized, while the high-dimensional transcriptomics data are mapped into a low-dimensional space spanned by metagenes that represent hidden biological signals. {jNMFMA} finally identifies {DEGs} as genes that are associated with differentially expressed metagenes. The ability of extracting dependence structures makes {jNMFMA} more efficient and robust to identify {DEGs} in meta-analysis context. Furthermore, {jNMFMA} is also flexible to identify {DEGs} that are consistent among various types of omics data, e.g. gene expression and {DNA} methylation. Experimental results on both simulation data and real-world cancer data demonstrate the effectiveness of {jNMFMA} and its superior performance over other popular approaches.

Whole chromosome gains are usually associated with low stage disease and favourable outcome, whereas loss of 1p, 3p and 11q, unbalanced gain of 17q and {MYCN} amplification ({MNA}) are indicative of high stage disease and unfavourable prognosis. Although {MNA} and loss of 11q appear to represent two distinct genetic subtypes of advanced stage neuroblastoma, a detailed understanding of how these subtypes differ in terms of global gene expression is still lacking. We have used metaphase comparative genomic hybridization ({CGH}) analysis in combination with oligonucleotide technology to identify patterns of gene expression that correlate with specific genomic imbalances found in primary neuroblastic tumours and cell lines. The tumours analysed in this manner included a ganglioneuroma, along with various ganglioneuroblastoma and neuroblastoma of different stages and histopathological classifications. Oligonucleotide microarray-based gene expression profile analysis was performed with Affymetrix {HU}133A arrays representing approximately 14 500 unique genes. The oligonucleotide microarray results were subsequently validated by quantitative real-time {PCR}, immunohistochemical staining, and by comparison of specific gene expression patterns with published results. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data distinguished tumours on the basis of stage, differentiation and genetic abnormalities. A number of genes were identified whose patterns of expression were highly correlated with 11q loss; supporting the concept that loss of 11q represents a distinct genetic subtype of neuroblastoma. The implications of these results in the process of neuroblastoma development and progression are discussed.},

Analysis of gene expression signatures from more than 3,000 human breast tumors found that genomic programs that measured vascular quantity, vascular proliferation, and a {VEGF}/Hypoxia-signature were the most highly expressed in claudin-low and basal-like tumors. The majority of the vascular gene signatures added metastasis-predictive information to immunohistochemistry-defined microvessel density scores and genomically defined-intrinsic subtype classification. Interestingly, pure claudin-low cell lines, and subsets of claudin-low-like cells within established basal-like cancer cell lines, exhibited endothelial/tube-like morphology when cultured on Matrigel. In vivo xenografts found that claudin-low tumors, but not luminal tumors, extensively perfused injected contrast agent through paracellular spaces and non-vascular tumor-lined channels. Taken together, the endothelial-like characteristics of the cancer cells, combined with both the amount and the physiologic state of the vasculature contribute to breast cancer metastatic progression.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Transforming growth factor beta ({TGFβ}), which is implicated in metastasis to various organs in breast cancer, is a potential target for new antitumor metastasis drugs.
{METHODS}: To identify specific inhibitors of {TGFβ} receptor 1 ({TGFβR}1) in breast cancer metastasis, a virtual library of more than 400000 different compounds was screened by molecular docking modeling and confirmed with Smad-binding element luciferase and {TGFβR}1 kinase assays. Affymetrix {GeneChip} expression analysis of {mRNA} levels and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine expression changes of {TGFβ}-mediated, metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer cells after treatment with the small-molecule inhibitor {YR}-290. {YR}-290 was also examined for its effects on breast cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis using transwell and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ({EMT}) assays in vitro and three different mouse ({BALB}/c and {NU}/{NU} nude) models (n = 10 per group). Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess survival. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: {YR}-290 interacted with the kinase domain of {TGFβR}1, abrogated kinase activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 137nM, 95\% confidence interval = 126.4 to 147.6nM) and inhibited the {TGFβ}-mediated downstream signaling pathway and metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer cells. {YR}-290 inhibited {TGFβ}-modulated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. In tumor metastasis mouse models, {YR}-290 almost completely blocked cancer metastasis. Numbers of lung tumor nodules of mice treated with 1mg/kg and 5mg/kg {YR}-290 were reduced by 74.93\% (95\% confidence interval = 61.45\% to 88.41\%) and 94.93\% (95\% confidence interval = 82.13\% to 100\%), respectively, compared with control mice. Treatment with {YR}-290 also statistically significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {YR}-290 is a novel inhibitor of tumor metastasis that works by blocking {TGFβ} signaling pathways.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Some molecular subtypes of breast cancer have preferential sites of distant relapse. The protein expression pattern of the primary tumor may influence the first distant metastasis site.
{METHODS}: We identified from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry patients diagnosed with breast cancer in five geographical regions Finland in 1991-1992, reviewed the hospital case records, and collected primary tumor tissue. Out of the 2,032 cases identified, 234 developed distant metastases after a median follow-up time of 2.7 years and had the first metastatic site documented (a total of 321 sites). Primary tumor microarray ({TMA}) cores were analyzed for 17 proteins using immunohistochemistry and for {erbB}2 using chromogenic in situ hybridization, and their associations with the first metastasis site were examined. The cancers were classified into luminal A, luminal B, {HER}2+ enriched, basal-like or non-expressor subtypes.
{RESULTS}: A total of 3,886 {TMA} cores were analyzed. Luminal A cancers had a propensity to give rise first to bone metastases, {HER}2-enriched cancers to liver and lung metastases, and basal type cancers to liver and brain metastases. Primary tumors that gave first rise to bone metastases expressed frequently estrogen receptor ({ER}) and {SNAI}1 ({SNAIL}) and rarely {COX}2 and {HER}2, tumors with first metastases in the liver expressed infrequently {SNAI}1, those with lung metastases expressed frequently the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}), cytokeratin-5 ({CK}5) and {HER}2, and infrequently progesterone receptor ({PgR}), tumors with early skin metastases expressed infrequently E-cadherin, and breast tumors with first metastases in the brain expressed nestin, prominin-1 and {CK}5 and infrequently {ER} and {PgR}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Breast tumor biological subtypes have a tendency to give rise to first distant metastases at certain body sites. Several primary tumor proteins were associated with homing of breast cancer cells.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Single sample predictors ({SSPs}) and Subtype classification models ({SCMs}) are gene expression-based classifiers used to identify the four primary molecular subtypes of breast cancer (basal-like, {HER}2-enriched, luminal A, and luminal B). {SSPs} use hierarchical clustering, followed by nearest centroid classification, based on large sets of tumor-intrinsic genes. {SCMs} use a mixture of Gaussian distributions based on sets of genes with expression specifically correlated with three key breast cancer genes (estrogen receptor [{ER}], {HER}2, and aurora kinase A [{AURKA}]). The aim of this study was to compare the robustness, classification concordance, and prognostic value of these classifiers with those of a simplified three-gene {SCM} in a large compendium of microarray datasets.
{METHODS}: Thirty-six publicly available breast cancer datasets (n = 5715) were subjected to molecular subtyping using five published classifiers (three {SSPs} and two {SCMs}) and {SCMGENE}, the new three-gene ({ER}, {HER}2, and {AURKA}) {SCM}. We used the prediction strength statistic to estimate robustness of the classification models, defined as the capacity of a classifier to assign the same tumors to the same subtypes independently of the dataset used to fit it. We used Cohen κ and Cramer V coefficients to assess concordance between the subtype classifiers and association with clinical variables, respectively. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and cross-validated partial likelihood to compare prognostic value of the resulting classifications. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: {SCMs} were statistically significantly more robust than {SSPs}, with {SCMGENE} being the most robust because of its simplicity. {SCMGENE} was statistically significantly concordant with published {SCMs} (κ = 0.65-0.70) and {SSPs} (κ = 0.34-0.59), statistically significantly associated with {ER} (V = 0.64), {HER}2 (V = 0.52) status, and histological grade (V = 0.55), and yielded similar strong prognostic value.
{CONCLUSION}: Our results suggest that adequate classification of the major and clinically relevant molecular subtypes of breast cancer can be robustly achieved with quantitative measurements of three key genes.},

	abstract = {Of the estimated 1 million cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually worldwide, it is estimated that over 170,000 will harbor the triple-negative (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/{HER}2-negative) phenotype. Most, though not all, triple-negative breast cancers will be basal-like on gene expression micorarrays. The basal-like molecular subtype exhibits a unique molecular profile and set of risk factors, aggressive and early pattern of metastasis, limited treatment options, and poor prognosis. Large population-based studies have identified a higher proportion of triple-negative breast tumors among premenopausal African American women, and a suggestion that increased parity, younger age at first-term pregnancy, shorter duration of breast feeding, and elevated hip-to-waist ratio might be particular risk factors. When {BRCA}1 mutation carriers develop breast cancer, it is usually basal-like; given the central role of {BRCA}1 in {DNA} repair, this could have profound therapeutic implications. When diagnosed, triple-negative breast cancers illustrate preferential relapse in visceral organs, including the central nervous system. Although initial response to chemotherapy might be more profound, relapse is early and common among triple-negative breast cancers compared with luminal breast cancers. The armamentarium of "targeted therapeutics" for triple-negative breast cancer is evolving and includes strategies to inhibit angiogenesis, epidermal growth factor receptor, and other kinases. Finally, the positive association between triple-negative breast cancer and {BRCA} mutations makes inhibition of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1 an attractive therapeutic strategy that is in active study.},

	abstract = {A multilinear subspace regression model based on so called latent variable decomposition is introduced. Unlike standard regression methods which typically employ matrix (2D) data representations followed by vector subspace transformations, the proposed approach uses tensor subspace transformations to model common latent variables across both the independent and dependent data. The proposed approach aims to maximize the correlation between the so derived latent variables and is shown to be suitable for the prediction of multidimensional dependent data from multidimensional independent data, where for the estimation of the latent variables we introduce an algorithm based on Multilinear Singular Value Decomposition ({MSVD}) on a specially defined cross-covariance tensor. It is next shown that in this way we are also able to unify the existing Partial Least Squares ({PLS}) and N-way {PLS} regression algorithms within the same framework. Simulations on benchmark synthetic data confirm the advantages of the proposed approach, in terms of its predictive ability and robustness, especially for small sample sizes. The potential of the proposed technique is further illustrated on a real world task of the decoding of human intracranial electrocorticogram ({ECoG}) from a simultaneously recorded scalp electroencephalograph ({EEG}). 1},

	abstract = {The tumor suppressor p53, encoded by the {TP}53 gene, is recognized as the guardian of the human genome because it regulates many downstream genes to exercise its function in cell cycle and cell death. Recent studies have revealed that several {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) are important components of the p53 tumor suppressor network with {miR}-125b and {miR}-504 directly targeting {TP}53. In this study, we use a screening method to identify that two {miRNAs} ({miR}-25 and {miR}-30d) directly target the 3'{UTR} of {TP}53 to downregulate p53 protein levels and reduce the expression of genes that are transcriptionally activated by p53. Correspondingly, both {miR}-25 and {miR}-30d adversely affect apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Inhibition of either {miR}-25 or {miR}-30d expression increases endogenous p53 expression and elevates cellular apoptosis in several cell lines, including one from multiple myeloma that has little {TP}53 mutations. Thus, beyond {miR}-125b and {miR}-504, the human {TP}53 gene is negatively regulated by two more {miRNAs}: {miR}-25 and {miR}-30d.},

It interacts with several cofactors (Atg14L, {UVRAG}, Bif-1, Rubicon, Ambra1, {HMGB}1, {nPIST}, {VMP}1, {SLAM}, {IP}(3)R, {PINK} and survivin) to regulate the lipid kinase Vps-34 protein and promote formation of Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 core complexes, thereby inducing autophagy. In contrast, the {BH}3 domain of Beclin 1 is bound to, and inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-{XL}. This interaction can be disrupted by phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1, or ubiquitination of Beclin 1. Interestingly, caspase-mediated cleavage of Beclin 1 promotes crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy. Beclin 1 dysfunction has been implicated in many disorders, including cancer and neurodegeneration. Here, we summarize new findings regarding the organization and function of the Beclin 1 network in cellular homeostasis, focusing on the cross-regulation between apoptosis and autophagy.},

	abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for renal cell carcinoma ({RCC}) and a poor prognostic factor across many tumor types. However, reports have suggested that {RCC} developing in an obesogenic environment may be more indolent. We recently reported on the favorable impact of body mass index ({BMI}) on survival in the International {mRCC} Database Consortium ({IMDC}). The current work aims to externally validate this finding and characterize the underlying biology.  Methods:    We conducted an analysis of 4,657 metastatic {RCC} ({mRCC}) patients (pts) treated on phase {II}-{III} clinical trials sponsored by Pfizer from 2003-2013. We assessed the impact of {BMI} on overall survival ({OS}), progression-free survival ({PFS}) and overall response rate ({ORR}). Additionally, we analysed metastatic pts from the clear cell {RCC} ({ccRCC}) cohort of {TCGA} dataset to correlate the expression of Fatty Acid Synthase ({FASN}) with {BMI} and {OS}.  Results:    At targeted therapy ({TT}) initiation, 1,829 (39\%) pts were normal or underweight ({BMI} {\textless}25 kg/m2) and 2,828 (61\%) were overweight or obese ({BMI} ≥25 kg/m2). Overall, the high {BMI} group had a longer median {OS} (23.4 months) than the low {BMI} group (14.5 months) (hazard ratio ({HR}) = 0.830, p= 0.0008, 95\% {CI} 0.743-0.925) after adjusting for the {IMDC} prognostic risk group and other risks factors. In addition, pts with high {BMI} had improved {PFS} ({HR}=0.821, 95\% {CI} 0.746-0.903, p{\textless}0.0001) and {ORR} (odds ratio =1.527, 95\% {CI} 1.258-1.855, p{\textless}0.001). These results remain valid when stratified by line of therapy. When stratified by histological subtype, the favorable outcome associated with high {BMI} was only observed in {ccRCC}. Toxicity patterns did not differ between {BMI} groups. In the the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) dataset (n=61), there was a trend towards improved {OS} in the high {BMI} group (p=0.07). {FASN} gene expression inversely correlated with both {OS} (p=0.002) and {BMI} (p=0.034).  Conclusions:  In an external cohort,we validate {BMI} as an independent prognostic factor for improved survival in {mRCC}. Given that this finding was observed in {ccRCC} only, we hypothesize that lipid metabolism may be modulated by the fat laden tumors cells. {FASN} staining in the {IMDC} cohort is ongoing to better investigate the obesity paradox in {mRCC}.},

	abstract = {Breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and Her2 amplification exhibit distinct gene expression profiles and clinical features, and they comprise the majority of {BRCA}1-associated tumors. Here we demonstrated that the p53 family member p63 controls a pathway for p73-dependent cisplatin sensitivity specific to these "triple-negative" tumors. In vivo, {DeltaNp}63 and {TAp}73 isoforms were coexpressed exclusively within a subset of triple-negative primary breast cancers that commonly exhibited mutational inactivation of p53. The {DeltaNp}63alpha isoform promoted survival of breast cancer cells by binding {TAp}73 and thereby inhibiting its proapoptotic activity. Consequently, inhibition of p63 by {RNA} interference led to {TAp}73-dependent induction of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and apoptosis. Breast cancer cells expressing {DeltaNp}63alpha and {TAp}73 exhibited cisplatin sensitivity that was uniquely dependent on {TAp}73. Thus, in response to treatment with cisplatin, but not other chemotherapeutic agents, {TAp}73 underwent c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation, which promoted dissociation of the {DeltaNp}63alpha/{TAp}73 protein complex, {TAp}73-dependent transcription of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and apoptosis. These findings define p63 as a survival factor in a subset of breast cancers; furthermore, they provide what we believe to be a novel mechanism for cisplatin sensitivity in these triple-negative cancers, and they suggest that such cancers may share the cisplatin sensitivity of {BRCA}1-associated tumors.},

Understanding how gender influences immunological mechanisms in health and disease and identifying gender-specific biomarkers could lead to specifically tailored treatment and ultimately improve therapeutic success rates. T helper1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines (Th1/Th2) have pivotal roles in the homeostasis of Th1 and Th2 cell network functions in the immune response but sex steroids affect Th1/Th2 production in different ways and a natural sexual dimorphism in the immune response has been shown. In order to investigate these differences further, we developed Th-cytokine data-driven models of the immune response and evaluated healthy subject peripheral blood samples. Independent cohorts of colorectal cancer and adenoma patients were also studied for comparison purposes. Our results show that the interferon ({IFN})γ production pathway for immune response homeostasis is specific to men whilst the interleukin- ({IL}-) 6 production pathway for immune response homeostasis is specific to women. The {IL}-10 pathway for restoring immune system resting homeostasis was common to both but was controlled by the respective gender-specific pathways. These gender pathways could well be used as targets and biomarkers in translational research into developing new clinical strategies.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Most tumor tissue is composed of parenchymal tumor cells and tumor stroma. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) can function as precursors for tumor stromal cells, including myofibroblasts, which provide a favorable environment for tumor progression. A close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a tumor microenvironment has been described. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are enriched with a discrete set of cellular proteins, and are therefore expected to exert diverse biological functions according to cell origin.
{METHODS}: In the current study, we determined the biological effect of exosomes from two ovarian cancer cell lines ({SK}-{OV}-3 and {OVCAR}-3) on adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}).
{RESULTS}: Exosome treatment induced {ADSCs} to exhibit the typical characteristics of tumor-associated myofibroblasts, with increased expression of α-{SMA}, and also increased expression of tumor-promoting factors ({SDF}-1 and {TGF}-β). This phenomenon was correlated with an increased expression of {TGF}-β receptors I and {II}. Analysis of {TGF}-β receptor-mediated downstream signaling pathways revealed that each exosome activated different signaling pathways, showing that exosomes from {SK}-{OV}-3 cells increased the phosphorylated form of {SMAD}2, which is essential in the {SMAD}-dependent pathway, whereas exosomes from {OVCAR}-3 cells increased the phosphorylated form of {AKT}, a representative {SMAD}-independent pathway. Taken together, exosomes from ovarian cancer cells induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} by activating an intracellular signaling pathway, although the activated pathway could differ from exosome-to-exosome.
{CONCLUSION}: The current study suggested that ovarian cancer-derived exosomes contribute to the generation of tumor-associated myofibroblasts from {MSCs} in tumor stroma.},

The most popular platform for genome-wide expression profiling is the Affymetrix {GeneChip}. However, its selection of probes relied on earlier genome and transcriptome annotation which is significantly different from current knowledge. The resultant informatics problems have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here, we address these critical issues and offer a solution. We identified several classes of problems at the individual probe level in the existing annotation, under the assumption that current genome and transcriptome databases are more accurate than those used for {GeneChip} design. We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular {GeneChips} into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of up-to-date genome, {cDNA}/{EST} clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing analysis results between the original and the redefined probe sets reveals ∼30–50\% discrepancy in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived from past {GeneChip} analyses may be significantly flawed. It will be beneficial to re-analyze existing {GeneChip} data with updated probe set definitions.},

Senataxin, a helicase protein associated with {AOA}2/{ALS}4 neurodegenerative disorders, acts to resolve these R-loop structures and by so doing allows access of the 5′–3′ exonuclease Xrn2 at 3′ cleavage poly(A) sites. This affords 3′ transcript degradation and consequent Pol {II} termination. In effect, R-loops formed over G-rich pause sites, followed by their resolution by senataxin, are key steps in the termination process.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) can promote carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Only limited data on the response of {CAFs} to chemotherapy and their potential impact on therapy outcome are available. This study was undertaken to analyze the influence of chemotherapy on carcinoma-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) in vitro and in vivo.
{METHODS}: The in vivo response of stromal cells to chemotherapy was investigated in 22 neoadjuvant treated breast tumors on tissue sections before and after chemotherapy. Response to chemotherapy was analyzed in vitro in primary cultures of isolated {CAFs} from 28 human lung and 9 breast cancer tissues. The response was correlated to Mdm2, {ERCC}1 and {TP}53 polymorphisms and {TP}53 mutation status. Additionally, the cytotoxic effects were evaluated in an ex vivo experiment using cultured tissue slices from 16 lung and 17 breast cancer specimens.
{RESULTS}: Nine of 22 tumors showed a therapy-dependent reduction of stromal activity. Pathological response of tumor or stroma cells did not correlate with clinical response. Isolated {CAFs} showed little sensitivity to paclitaxel. In contrast, sensitivity of {CAFs} to cisplatinum was highly variable with a {GI}50 ranging from 2.8 to 29.0 {microM} which is comparable to the range observed in tumor cell lines. No somatic {TP}53 mutation was detected in any of the 28 {CAFs} from lung cancer tissue. In addition, response to cisplatinum was not significantly associated with the genotype of {TP}53 nor Mdm2 and {ERCC}1 polymorphisms. However, we observed a non-significant trend towards decreased sensitivity in the presence of {TP}53 variant genotype. In contrast to the results obtained in isolated cell culture, in tissue slice culture breast cancer {CAFs} responded to paclitaxel within their microenvironment in the majority of cases (9/14). The opposite was observed in lung cancer tissues: only few {CAFs} were sensitive to cisplatinum within their microenvironment (2/15) whereas a higher proportion responded to cisplatinum in isolated culture.
{CONCLUSION}: Similar to cancer cells, {CAF} response to chemotherapy is highly variable. Beside significant individual/intrinsic differences the sensitivity of {CAFs} seems to depend also on the cancer type as well as the microenvironment.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: At least four major categories of invasive breast cancer that are associated with different clinical outcomes have been identified by gene expression profiling: luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2) and basal-like. However, the prevalence of these phenotypes among cases of ductal carcinoma in situ ({DCIS}) has not been previously evaluated in detail. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of these distinct molecular subtypes among cases of {DCIS} and invasive breast cancer. {METHODS}: We constructed tissue microarrays ({TMAs}) from breast cancers that developed in 2897 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (1976 to 1996). {TMA} slides were immunostained for oestrogen receptor ({ER}), progesterone receptor ({PR}), {HER}2, cytokeratin 5/6 ({CK}5/6) and epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}). Using these immunostain results, cases were grouped into molecularly defined subtypes. {RESULTS}: The prevalence of the distinct molecular phenotypes differed significantly between {DCIS} (n = 272) and invasive breast cancers (n = 2249). The luminal A phenotype was significantly more frequent among invasive cancers (73.4\%) than among {DCIS} lesions (62.5\%) (p = 0.0002). In contrast, luminal B and {HER}2 molecular phenotypes were both more frequent among {DCIS} (13.2\% and 13.6\%, respectively) as compared with invasive tumours (5.2\% and 5.7\%, respectively) (p {\textless} 0.0001). The basal-like phenotype was more frequent among the invasive cancers (10.9\%) than {DCIS} (7.7\%), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.15). High-grade {DCIS} and invasive tumours were more likely to be {HER}2 type and basal-like than low- or intermediate-grade lesions. Among invasive tumours, basal-like and {HER}2 type tumours were more likely to be more than 2 cm in size, high-grade and have nodal involvement compared with luminal A tumours. {CONCLUSION}: The major molecular phenotypes previously identified among invasive breast cancers were also identified among cases of {DCIS}. However, the prevalence of the luminal A, luminal B and {HER}2 phenotypes differed significantly between {DCIS} and invasive breast cancers.},

	abstract = {Il4 and Il13 encode the canonical T helper 2 ({TH}2) cytokines responsible both for promoting immune responses against extracellular pathogens and, when misregulated, causing allergic and autoimmune disease. The expression potential of these genes undergoes developmentally programmed repression and enhancement during commitment of naïve {CD}4+ T cells to the mature T helper 1 ({TH}1) and {TH}2 fates, respectively. Thus, like the globin locus, the {TH}2 cytokine locus provides a highly tractable system to study a developmental fate choice leading to alternative transcriptional states of either silence or permissivity. We used quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and {RT}-{PCR} to correlate changes in the transcriptional states of Il4 and Il13 with markers of permissive chromatin across the Il4-Il13 locus in naïve {CD}4+ T cells undergoing {TH}1 and {TH}2 differentiation. We provide evidence that {DNaseI} hypersensitive site V in the Il4 3' enhancer is the likely target for signals maintaining Il4 and Il13 transcriptional permissivity in naïve cells. We also demonstrate rapid acquisition of differences in H3 acetylation between {TH}1- and {TH}2-primed cells, indicating a developmentally early role for cytokine signaling in the process of {TH} cell fate determination. Finally, we show that transcriptional repression correlates with the disappearance of permissive H3 modifications from everywhere in the Il4-Il13 locus except hypersensitive site {IV}, suggesting a critical role for this element in the maintenance of transcriptional repression. Our findings are consistent with a progressive regulatory element activation/deactivation model of {TH}1/{TH}2 development.},

It is unclear, however, whether these phenotypic similarities reflect the activity of common molecular pathways. Here, we analyze the enrichment patterns of gene sets associated with embryonic stem ({ES}) cell identity in the expression profiles of various human tumor types. We find that histologically poorly differentiated tumors show preferential overexpression of genes normally enriched in {ES} cells, combined with preferential repression of Polycomb-regulated genes. Moreover, activation targets of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc are more frequently overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. In breast cancers, this {ES}-like signature is associated with high-grade estrogen receptor ({ER})-negative tumors, often of the basal-like subtype, and with poor clinical outcome. The {ES} signature is also present in poorly differentiated glioblastomas and bladder carcinomas. We identify a subset of {ES} cell-associated transcription regulators that are highly expressed in poorly differentiated tumors. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between genes associated with {ES} cell identity and the histopathological traits of tumors and support the possibility that these genes contribute to stem cell-like phenotypes shown by many tumors.},

When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to {IGF}1 receptor inhibitors; {AHR} expression was associated with {MEK} inhibitor efficacy in {NRAS}-mutant lines; and {SLFN}11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies aiming to understand the biology of exosomes, as well as other extracellular vesicles. However, classification of membrane vesicles and the appropriate protocols for their isolation are still under intense discussion and investigation. When isolating vesicles, it is crucial to use systems that are able to separate them, to avoid cross-contamination.
{METHOD}: {EVS} {RELEASED} {FROM} {THREE} {DIFFERENT} {KINDS} {OF} {CELL} {LINES}: {HMC}-1, {TF}-1 and {BV}-2 were isolated using two centrifugation-based protocols. In protocol 1, apoptotic bodies were collected at 2,000×g, followed by filtering the supernatant through 0.8 µm pores and pelleting of microvesicles at 12,200×g. In protocol 2, apoptotic bodies and microvesicles were collected together at 16,500×g, followed by filtering of the supernatant through 0.2 µm pores and pelleting of exosomes at 120,000×g. Extracellular vesicles were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and the {RNA} profiles were investigated using a Bioanalyzer(®).
{RESULTS}: {RNA} profiles showed that ribosomal {RNA} was primary detectable in apoptotic bodies and smaller {RNAs} without prominent ribosomal {RNA} peaks in exosomes. In contrast, microvesicles contained little or no {RNA} except for microvesicles collected from {TF}-1 cell cultures. The different vesicle pellets showed highly different distribution of size, shape and electron density with typical apoptotic body, microvesicle and exosome characteristics when analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Flow cytometry revealed the presence of {CD}63 and {CD}81 in all vesicles investigated, as well as {CD}9 except in the {TF}-1-derived vesicles, as these cells do not express {CD}9.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results demonstrate that centrifugation-based protocols are simple and fast systems to distinguish subpopulations of extracellular vesicles. Different vesicles show different {RNA} profiles and morphological characteristics, but they are indistinguishable using {CD}63-coated beads for flow cytometry analysis.},

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in {\textasciitilde}40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by {CNAs}, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in {PPP}2R2A, {MTAP} and {MAP}2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired {DNA}–{RNA} profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘{CNA}-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic {CNAs} on the transcriptome.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine the role of {miR}-378 as a biomarker for anti-angiogenic therapy response in ovarian cancer.
{METHODS}: Expression of {miR}-378 was analyzed in ovarian cancer cell lines and human tumors vs. normal ovarian epithelial cells by {qRT}-{PCR}. After {miR}-378 transfection in {SKOV}3 cells, dysregulated genes were identified using microarray. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) was utilized to correlate {miR}-378 expression with progression-free survival ({PFS}) among patients treated with anti-angiogenic therapy by using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards.
{RESULTS}: {MiR}-378 was overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and tumors vs. normal ovarian epithelial cells. Overexpressing {miR}-378 in ovarian cancer cells altered expression of genes associated with angiogenesis ({ALCAM}, {EHD}1, {ELK}3, {TLN}1), apoptosis ({RPN}2, {HIPK}3), and cell cycle regulation ({SWAP}-70, {LSM}14A, {RDX}). In the {TCGA} dataset, low vs. high {miR}-378 expression was associated with longer {PFS} in a subset of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with bevacizumab (9.2 vs. 4.2months; p=0.04). On multivariate analysis, {miR}-378 expression was an independent predictor for {PFS} after anti-angiogenic treatment ({HR}=2.04, 95\% {CI}: 1.12-3.72; p=0.02). Furthermore, expression levels of two {miR}-378 targets ({ALCAM} and {EHD}1) were associated with {PFS} in this subgroup of patients who received anti-angiogenic therapy (9.4 vs. 4.2months, p=0.04 for high vs. low {ALCAM}; 7.9 vs. 2.3months, p{\textless}0.01 for low vs. high {EHD}1).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our data suggest that {miR}-378 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and tumors vs. normal ovarian epithelial cells. {MiR}-378 and its downstream targets may serve as markers for response to anti-angiogenic therapy.},

An integrated genomic profiling approach measuring multiple omics data types simultaneously in the same set of biological samples would render an integrated data resolution that would not be available with any single data type. In this study, we use penalized latent variable regression methods for joint modeling of multiple omics data types to identify common latent variables that can be used to cluster patient samples into biologically and clinically relevant disease subtypes. We consider lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005), and fused lasso (Tibshirani et al., 2005) methods to induce sparsity in the coefficient vectors, revealing important genomic features that have significant contributions to the latent variables. An iterative ridge regression is used to compute the sparse coefficient vectors. In model selection, a uniform design (Fang and Wang, 1994) is used to seek "experimental" points that scattered uniformly across the search domain for efficient sampling of tuning parameter combinations. We compared our method to sparse singular value decomposition ({SVD}) and penalized Gaussian mixture model ({GMM}) using both real and simulated data sets. The proposed method is applied to integrate genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data for subtype analysis in breast and lung cancer data sets.},

Previously validated hypoxia-regulated genes (seeds) were used to generate hypoxia co-expression cancer networks. {RESULTS}: A common hypoxia signature, or metagene, was derived by selecting genes that were consistently co-expressed with the hypoxia seeds in multiple cancers. This was highly enriched for hypoxia-regulated pathways, and prognostic in multivariate analyses. Genes with the highest connectivity were also the most prognostic, and a reduced metagene consisting of a small number of top-ranked genes, including {VEGFA}, {SLC}2A1 and {PGAM}1, outperformed both a larger signature and reported signatures in independent data sets of head and neck, breast and lung cancers. {CONCLUSION}: Combined knowledge of multiple genes' function from in vitro experiments together with meta-analysis of multiple cancers can deliver compact and robust signatures suitable for clinical application.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: High-grade serous cancer ({HGSC}) is the most common cancer of the ovary and is characterized by chromosomal instability. Defects in homologous recombination repair ({HRR}) are associated with genomic instability in {HGSC}, and are exploited by therapy targeting {DNA} repair. Defective {HRR} causes uniparental deletions and loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}). Our purpose is to profile {LOH} in {HGSC} and correlate our findings to clinical outcome, and compare {HGSC} and high-grade breast cancers.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We examined {LOH} and copy number changes using single nucleotide polymorphism array data from three {HGSC} cohorts and compared results to a cohort of high-grade breast cancers. The {LOH} profiles in {HGSC} were matched to chemotherapy resistance and progression-free survival ({PFS}).
{RESULTS}: {LOH}-based clustering divided {HGSC} into two clusters. The major group displayed extensive {LOH} and was further divided into two subgroups. The second group contained remarkably less {LOH}. {BRCA}1 promoter methylation was associated with the major group. {LOH} clusters were reproducible when validated in two independent {HGSC} datasets. {LOH} burden in the major cluster of {HGSC} was similar to triple-negative, and distinct from other high-grade breast cancers. Our analysis revealed an {LOH} cluster with lower treatment resistance and a significant correlation between {LOH} burden and {PFS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Separating {HGSC} by {LOH}-based clustering produces remarkably stable subgroups in three different cohorts. Patients in the various {LOH} clusters differed with respect to chemotherapy resistance, and the extent of {LOH} correlated with {PFS}. {LOH} burden may indicate vulnerability to treatment targeting {DNA} repair, such as {PARP}1 inhibitors.},

We performed in vivo selection using 4T1 breast cancer cells to identify genes associated with the liver metastatic phenotype. Coincident with the loss of numerous tight-junctional proteins, we observe claudin-2 overexpression, specifically in liver-aggressive breast cancer cells. We further demonstrate that claudin-2 is both necessary and sufficient for the ability of 4T1 breast cancer cells to colonize and grow in the liver. The liver-aggressive breast cancer cells display a claudin-2-mediated increase in their ability to adhere to extracellular matrix ({ECM}) components, such as fibronectin and type {IV} collagen. Claudin-2 facilitates these cell/matrix interactions by increasing the cell surface expression of α(2)β(1)- and α(5)β(1)-integrin complexes in breast cancer cells. Indeed, claudin-2-mediated adhesion to fibronectin and type {IV} collagen can be blocked with neutralizing antibodies that target α(5)β(1) and α(2)β(1) complexes, respectively. Immunohistochemical analyses reveal that claudin-2, although weakly expressed in primary human breast cancers, is readily detected in all liver metastasis samples examined to date. Together, these results uncover novel roles for claudin-2 in promoting breast cancer adhesion to the {ECM} and define its importance during breast cancer metastasis to the liver.},

	abstract = {A causal role was recently attributed to inflammation in many malignant diseases, including breast cancer. The different inflammatory mediators that are involved in this disease include cells, cytokines and chemokines. Of these, many studies have addressed the involvement and roles of the inflammatory chemokines {CCL}2 ({MCP}-1) and {CCL}5 ({RANTES}) in breast malignancy. While minimally expressed by normal breast epithelial duct cells, both chemokines are highly expressed by breast tumor cells at primary tumor sites, indicating that {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 expression is acquired in the course of malignant transformation, and suggesting that the two chemokines play a role in breast cancer development and/or progression. Supporting this possibility are findings showing significant associations between {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 and more advanced disease course and progression. Furthermore, studies in animal model systems have shown active and causative roles for the two chemokines in this disease. In line with the tumor-promoting roles of {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 in breast cancer, the two chemokines were shown to mediate many types of tumor-promoting cross-talks between the tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment: (1) they shift the balance at the tumor site between different leukocyte cell types by increasing the presence of deleterious tumor-associated macrophages ({TAM}) and inhibiting potential anti-tumor T cell activities; (2) of the two chemokines, mainly {CCL}2 promotes angiogenesis; (3) {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 which are expressed by cells of the tumor microenvironment osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells play a role in breast metastatic processes. In addition, both chemokines act directly on the tumor cells to promote their pro-malignancy phenotype, by increasing their migratory and invasion-related properties. Together, the overall current information suggests that {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 are inflammatory mediators with pro-malignancy activities in breast cancer, and that they should be considered as potential therapeutic targets for the limitation of this disease.},

	abstract = {Recently we showed that exchanging intact casein with extensively hydrolysed casein in Western diets prevented diet-induced obesity in obesity-prone C57BL/6J mice. To gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms for the metabolic alterations induced by intake of hydrolysed casein, we performed an exploratory investigation using proton {NMR} spectroscopy, multi-block {PCA} ({MBPCA}) and a multi-compartment model including analyses of plasma, urine, faeces and tissue samples from mice fed diets with intact or hydrolysed casein and 16 or 32 energy\% protein. The {MBPCA} superscores showed a clear separation between samples from mice fed intact and hydrolysed casein diets, respectively. Block loadings revealed that fecal fat content was higher, and tissue and plasma lipid levels were lower in mice fed hydrolysed casein diets compared with mice fed intact casein. Amino acid metabolism was also altered by dietary protein form, and levels of branched-chain amino acids were higher in faeces and urine and lower in plasma and spleen in mice fed hydrolysed protein. Moreover, hepatic levels of the sulphur-containing metabolites taurine and glutathione were increased in mice fed hydrolysed casein, and hepatic glycogen amount was increased in mice fed hydrolysed casein. In contrast, the levels of glucose and its metabolite lactate were reduced in faeces, liver and plasma. Taken together, {NMR}-based metabolomic analyses indicated that pathways within lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism were altered by intake of hydrolysed casein, and that these alterations are likely to be underlying mechanisms for the observed prevention against diet-induced obesity associated with hydrolysed casein intake.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: Cross-platform analysis of gene express data requires multiple, intricate processes at different layers with various platforms. However, existing tools handle only a single platform and are not flexible enough to support custom changes, which arise from the new statistical methods, updated versions of reference data, and better platforms released every month or year. Current tools are so tightly coupled with reference information, such as reference genome, transcriptome database, and {SNP}, which are often erroneous or outdated, that the output results are incorrect and misleading. {RESULTS}: We developed {AnyExpress}, a software package that combines cross-platform gene expression data using a fast interval-matching algorithm. Supported platforms include next-generation-sequencing technology, microarray, {SAGE}, {MPSS}, and more. Users can define custom target transcriptome database references for probe/read mapping in any species, as well as criteria to remove undesirable probes/reads. {AnyExpress} offers scalable processing features such as binding, normalization, and summarization that are not present in existing software tools. As a case study, we applied {AnyExpress} to published Affymetrix microarray and Illumina {NGS} {RNA}-Seq data from human kidney and liver. The mean of within-platform correlation coefficient was 0.98 for within-platform samples in kidney and liver, respectively. The mean of cross-platform correlation coefficients was 0.73. These results confirmed those of the original and secondary studies. Applying filtering produced higher agreement between microarray and {NGS}, according to an agreement index calculated from differentially expressed genes. {CONCLUSION}: {AnyExpress} can combine cross-platform gene expression data, process data from both open- and closed-platforms, select a custom target reference, filter out undesirable probes or reads based on custom-defined biological features, and perform quantile-normalization with a large number of microarray samples. {AnyExpress} is fast, comprehensive, flexible, and freely available at http://anyexpress.sourceforge.net.},

This vast repository is still underutilized due to the lack of methods for fast, accurate exploration of the entire compendium. {RESULTS}: We have collected Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression microarray data containing roughly 2400 experimental conditions. We analyzed the functional coverage of this collection and we designed a context-sensitive search algorithm for rapid exploration of the compendium. A researcher using our system provides a small set of query genes to establish a biological search context; based on this query, we weight each dataset's relevance to the context, and within these weighted datasets we identify additional genes that are co-expressed with the query set. Our method exhibits an average increase in accuracy of 273\% compared to previous mega-clustering approaches when recapitulating known biology. Further, we find that our search paradigm identifies novel biological predictions that can be verified through further experimentation. Our methodology provides the ability for biological researchers to explore the totality of existing microarray data in a manner useful for drawing conclusions and formulating hypotheses, which we believe is invaluable for the research community. {AVAILABILITY}: Our query-driven search engine, called {SPELL}, is available at http://function.princeton.edu/{SPELL}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Several additional data files, figures and discussions are available at http://function.princeton.edu/{SPELL}/supplement.},

We examined the association between mammographic density and breast cancer risk in {AA} and white women. Cases (n = 491) and controls (n = 528) were from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study ({CBCS}) who also had mammograms recorded in the Carolina Mammography Registry ({CMR}). Mammographic density was reported to {CMR} using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System ({BI}-{RADS}) categories. Increasing mammographic density was associated with increased breast cancer risk among all women. After adjusting for potential confounders, a monotonically increasing risk of breast cancer was observed between the highest versus the lowest {BI}-{RADS} density categories [{OR} = 2.45, (95 \% confidence interval: 0.99, 6.09)]. The association was stronger in whites, with {\textasciitilde}40 \% higher risk among those with extremely dense breasts compared to those with scattered fibroglandular densities [1.39, (0.75, 2.55)]. In {AA} women, the same comparison suggested lower risk [0.75, (0.30, 1.91)]. Because age, obesity, and exogenous hormones have strong associations with breast cancer risk, mammographic density, and race in the {CBCS}, effect measure modification by these factors was considered. Consistent with previous literature, density-associated risk was greatest among those with {BMI} {\textgreater} 30 and current hormone users (P value = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). In the {CBCS}, mammographic density is associated with increased breast cancer risk, with some suggestion of effect measure modification by race, although results were not statistically significant. However, exposures such as {BMI} and hormone therapy may be important modifiers of this association and merit further investigation.},

It does not require prior knowledge of the number or size of clusters. When applied to simulated data, it outperforms commonly used clustering methods, discovers overlapping clusters of diverse sizes and is robust in the presence of noise.

To address these issues, we utilized two bioinformatics approaches, coefficients of variances and resampling tests, to identify probes showing stable methylation levels from several independent microarray datasets. Mass spectrometry validated the consistently high methylation levels of the five probes (N4BP2, {EGFL}8, {CTRB}1, {TSPAN}3, and {ZNF}690) in 13 human tissue types from 24 cell lines. Linear associations between detected methylation levels and methyl concentrations of {DNA} samples were further demonstrated in three genes (N4BP2, {EGFL}8, and {CTRB}1). To summarize, we identified five genes which may serve as internal controls for methylation studies by analyzing large-scale microarray data, and three of them can be used as markers for evaluating the efficiency of bisulfite conversion.},

Here, we show that {MAP}3K4 controls the activity of the histone acetyltransferase {CBP}, and that acetylation of histones H2A and H2B by {CBP} is required to maintain the epithelial phenotype. Combined loss of {MAP}3K4/{CBP} activity represses expression of epithelial genes and causes {TS} cells to undergo {EMT} while maintaining their self-renewal and multipotency properties. The expression profile of {MAP}3K4-deficient {TS} cells defines an H2B acetylation-regulated gene signature that closely overlaps with that of human breast cancer cells.

Exosomes are secreted microvesicles that are emerging as potent mediators of cell–cell communication that are of particular importance in tumor–stroma interactions. The Wnt-planar cell polarity ({PCP}) pathway is the primary regulator of convergent extension cell movements during vertebrate development, but the role of this signaling pathway in cancer cell migration and metastasis has been unclear. Recently, we revealed that fibroblasts secrete exosomes that promote breast cancer cell ({BCC}) protrusive activity, motility, and metastasis by activating autocrine Wnt-{PCP} signaling in {BCCs}. Moreover, we showed that Wnt ligands produced by {BCCs} tether to fibroblast exosomes upon trafficking of exosomes in {BCCs}. These findings have several implications that motivate promising future research in the fields of tumor–stroma communication, exosome function, and Wnt-{PCP} signaling in cancer metastasis.

The unique stromal-epithelial interactions, and more generally, microenvironmental features of basal-like breast cancers have not been well characterized. To identify characteristic microenvironment features of basal-like breast cancer, we performed cocultures of several basal-like breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts and compared these with cocultures of luminal breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts. Interactions between basal-like cancer cells and fibroblasts induced expression of numerous interleukins and chemokines, including {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {CXCL}1, {CXCL}3, and {TGFβ}. Under the influence of fibroblasts, basal-like breast cancer cell lines also showed increased migration in vitro. Migration was less pronounced for luminal lines; but, these lines were more likely to have altered proliferation. These differences were relevant to tumor biology in vivo, as the gene set that distinguished luminal and basal-like stromal interactions in coculture also distinguishes basal-like from luminal tumors with 98\% accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation and 100\% accuracy in an independent test set. However, comparisons between cocultures where cells were in direct contact and cocultures where interaction was solely through soluble factors suggest that there is an important impact of direct cell-to-cell contact. The phenotypes and gene expression changes invoked by cancer cell interactions with fibroblasts support the microenvironment and cell-cell interactions as intrinsic features of breast cancer subtypes.},

	abstract = {Drug resistance presents a challenge to the treatment of cancer patients. Many studies have focused on cell-autonomous mechanisms of drug resistance. By contrast, we proposed that the tumour micro-environment confers innate resistance to therapy. Here we developed a co-culture system to systematically assay the ability of 23 stromal cell types to influence the innate resistance of 45 cancer cell lines to 35 anticancer drugs. We found that stroma-mediated resistance is common, particularly to targeted agents. We characterized further the stroma-mediated resistance of {BRAF}-mutant melanoma to {RAF} inhibitors because most patients with this type of cancer show some degree of innate resistance. Proteomic analysis showed that stromal cell secretion of hepatocyte growth factor ({HGF}) resulted in activation of the {HGF} receptor {MET}, reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) and phosphatidylinositol-3-{OH} kinase ({PI}(3)K)–{AKT} signalling pathways, and immediate resistance to {RAF} inhibition. Immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed stromal cell expression of {HGF} in patients with {BRAF}-mutant melanoma and showed a significant correlation between {HGF} expression by stromal cells and innate resistance to {RAF} inhibitor treatment. Dual inhibition of {RAF} and either {HGF} or {MET} resulted in reversal of drug resistance, suggesting {RAF} plus {HGF} or {MET} inhibitory combination therapy as a potential therapeutic strategy for {BRAF}-mutant melanoma. A similar resistance mechanism was uncovered in a subset of {BRAF}-mutant colorectal and glioblastoma cell lines. More generally, this study indicates that the systematic dissection of interactions between tumours and their micro-environment can uncover important mechanisms underlying drug resistance.},

	abstract = {Basal-like breast cancers have several well-characterized distinguishing molecular features, but most of these are features of the cancer cells themselves. The unique stromal-epithelial interactions, and more generally, microenvironmental features of basal-like breast cancers have not been well characterized. To identify characteristic microenvironment features of basal-like breast cancer, we performed cocultures of several basal-like breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts and compared these with cocultures of luminal breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts. Interactions between basal-like cancer cells and fibroblasts induced expression of numerous interleukins and chemokines, including {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {CXCL}1, {CXCL}3, and {TGFβ}. Under the influence of fibroblasts, basal-like breast cancer cell lines also showed increased migration in vitro. Migration was less pronounced for luminal lines; but, these lines were more likely to have altered proliferation. These differences were relevant to tumor biology in vivo, as the gene set that distinguished luminal and basal-like stromal interactions in coculture also distinguishes basal-like from luminal tumors with 98\% accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation and 100\% accuracy in an independent test set. However, comparisons between cocultures where cells were in direct contact and cocultures where interaction was solely through soluble factors suggest that there is an important impact of direct cell-to-cell contact. The phenotypes and gene expression changes invoked by cancer cell interactions with fibroblasts support the microenvironment and cell-cell interactions as intrinsic features of breast cancer subtypes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Cancer results from the accumulation of alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressors are classically defined as genes which contribute to tumorigenesis if their function is lost. Genetic or epigenetic alterations inactivating such genes may arise during somatic cell divisions or alternatively may be inherited from a parent. One notable exception to this rule is the {BRCA}1 tumor suppressor that predisposes to hereditary breast cancer when lost. Genetic alterations of this gene are hardly ever observed in sporadic breast cancer, while individuals harboring a germline mutation readily accumulate a second alteration inactivating the remaining allele--a finding which represents a conundrum in cancer genetics. In this paper, we present a novel mathematical framework of sporadic and hereditary breast tumorigenesis. We study the dynamics of genetic alterations driving breast tumorigenesis and explore those scenarios which can explain the absence of somatic {BRCA}1 alterations while replicating all other disease statistics. Our results support the existence of a heterozygous phenotype of {BRCA}1 and suggest that the loss of one {BRCA}1 allele may suppress the fitness advantage caused by the inactivation of other tumor suppressor genes. This paper contributes to the mathematical investigation of breast tumorigenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Canonical correspondence analysis ({CCA}) is a multivariate method to elucidate the relationships between biological assemblages of species and their environment. The method is designed to extract synthetic environmental gradients from ecological data-sets. The gradients are the basis for succinctly describing and visualizing the differential habitat preferences (niches) of taxavia an ordination diagram. Linear multivariate methods for relating two set of variables, such as two-block Partial Least Squares ({PLS}2), canonical correlation analysis and redundancy analysis, are less suited for this purpose because habitat preferences are often unimodal functions of habitat variables. After pointing out the key assumptions underlying {CCA}, the paper focuses on the interpretation of {CCA} ordination diagrams. Subsequently, some advanced uses, such as ranking environmental variables in importance and the statistical testing of effects are illustrated on a typical macroinvertebrate data-set. The paper closes with comparisons with correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis, {PLS}2 and co-inertia analysis. In an appendix a new method, named {CCA}-{PLS}, is proposed that combines the strong features of {CCA} and {PLS}2.},

Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80\% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used {DNA} microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of {BRCA}1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome.

The {FSH} or insulin-like growth factor 1 treatment in vitro reduced granulosa cell {CARTPT} {mRNA} in a dose-dependent fashion.

Aims To examine expression of {CTHRC}1 together with periostin and versican in breast cancer patients and investigate its association with clinicopathological characteristics. Methods The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 173 invasive carcinomas (classified into {WHO} histotypes and luminal, triple negative and Her2 subtypes), as well as normal tissues, precursor lesions and metastatic lymph nodes were stained by relevant antibodies, assessed semiquantitatively by histoscore and statistically evaluated. Results Expression of {CTHRC}1, versican and periostin was significantly higher in breast cancer than in normal tissue or precursor lesions. {CTHRC}1 stromal expression was enhanced in triple negative cases and also in patients with bone metastasis. Periostin expression was high in primary tumours, in particular triple negative ones, and also in their lymph node metastases. Cox regression analysis showed that in patients with high periostin, the risk of bone metastases increased with increased {CTHRC}1 expression. Conclusions {CTHRC}1 and periostin play important roles in breast cancer progression. These preliminary results show that combined evaluation of {CTHRC}1 and periostin could serve as a potential marker for breast cancer bone metastasis; the other observations contribute to the description of the tumour microenvironment, with implications for lymph node and bone metastasis.},

Technically, this is done genome-wide without prior restriction or knowledge of biological feasibility in scans referred to as genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}). Depending on the linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) structure at a particular locus, such {tagSNPs} may be surrogates for many thousands of other {SNPs}, and it is difficult to distinguish those that may play a functional role in the phenotype from those simply genetically linked. Because a large proportion of {tagSNPs} have been identified within non-coding regions of the genome, distinguishing functional from non-functional {SNPs} has been an even greater challenge. A strategy was recently proposed that prioritizes surrogate {SNPs} based on non-coding chromatin and epigenomic mapping techniques that have become feasible with the advent of massively parallel sequencing. Here, we introduce an R/Bioconductor software package that enables the identification of candidate functional {SNPs} by integrating information from {tagSNP} locations, lists of linked {SNPs} from the 1000 genomes project and locations of chromatin features which may have functional significance.

This method which is based on performing multivariate ordination of groups proved to be very efficient for both classification of samples into pre-defined groups and disease class prediction of new unknown samples. Classification and prediction with {BGA} are classically performed using the whole set of genes and no variable selection is required. We hypothesize that an optimized selection of highly discriminating genes might improve the prediction power of {BGA}. {RESULTS}: We propose an optimized between-group classification ({OBC}) which uses a jackknife-based gene selection procedure. {OBC} emphasizes classification accuracy rather than feature selection. {OBC} is a backward optimization procedure that maximizes the percentage of between group inertia by removing the least influential genes one by one from the analysis. This selects a subset of highly discriminative genes which optimize disease class prediction. We apply {OBC} to four datasets and compared it to other classification methods. {CONCLUSION}: {OBC} considerably improved the classification and predictive accuracy of {BGA}, when assessed using independent data sets and leave-one-out cross-validation. {AVAILABILITY}: The R code is freely available [see Additional file 1] as well as supplementary information [see Additional file 2].},

This series included 415 (8\%) patients with pure {ILC} and 2901 (55.7\%) with {IDC} (not otherwise specified) identified from a consecutive cohort of 5680 breast tumours presented to our Breast Unit that were treated in a similar conventional manner. Clinicopathological, therapy and outcome information as well as data on a large panel of biomarkers were available. {RESULTS}: Compared to {IDC}, patients with {ILC} tended to be older and present with tumours which are more frequently lower grade (typically, grade 2 [84\%]), hormone-receptor positive (86\% compared to 61\% in {IDC}), of larger size, and with the absence of vascular invasion. A higher frequency of {ILC} was placed in the good Nottingham Prognostic Index group (40\% compared to 21\% in {IDC}). {ILC} showed indolent but progressive behavioural characteristics with nearly linear survival curves which crossed those of {IDC} after approximately 10years of follow-up, thus eventually exhibiting a worse long-term outcome.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the main cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Microvesicles ({MVs}) are fragments of the plasma membrane secreted from cytoplasmic membrane compartments by normal and malignant cells. An increase in {MV} number has been found in peripheral blood of patients with several diseases including cancer. We hypothesized that {MV} number and the relative amount of focal adhesion kinase ({FAK}) and epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) proteins in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} are related to the presence of breast cancer.
Methods
Plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} were obtained by differential centrifugation of blood samples. {MV} number was evaluated by {BD} {TruCOUNT} Tubes ({BD} Biosciences). {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins were analyzed by Western blot.
Results
{MV} number in plasma fractions enriched with {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} is higher in breast cancer patients with stages I–{IV} as well as with T2–T4 tumors, in comparison to control group. In addition, plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} present {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins and their amount is increased in some stages of breast cancer in comparison to control group.
Conclusions
Our findings strongly suggest that {MV} number and the amount of {FAK} and {EGFR} in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} are associated with some stages of breast cancer.},

Hypoxia is an important feature of solid tumours which promotes tumour progression, angiogenesis and metastasis, potentially through exosome-mediated signalling.
{METHODS}: Breast cancer cell lines were cultured under either moderate (1\% O2) or severe (0.1\% O2) hypoxia. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis ({NTA}) and immunoblotting for the exosomal protein {CD}63 in order to assess the impact of hypoxia on exosome release. Hypoxic exosome fractions were assayed for {miR}-210 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and normalised to exogenous and endogenous control genes. Statistical significance was determined using the Student T test with a P value of {\textless} 0.05 considered significant.
{RESULTS}: Exposure of three different breast cancer cell lines to moderate (1\% O2) and severe (0.1\% O2) hypoxia resulted in significant increases in the number of exosomes present in the conditioned media as determined by {NTA} and {CD}63 immunoblotting. Activation of hypoxic signalling by dimethyloxalylglycine, a hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF}) hydroxylase inhibitor, resulted in significant increase in exosome release. Transfection of cells with {HIF}-1α {siRNA} prior to hypoxic exposure prevented the enhancement of exosome release by hypoxia. The hypoxically regulated {miR}-210 was identified to be present at elevated levels in hypoxic exosome fractions.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data provide evidence that hypoxia promotes the release of exosomes by breast cancer cells, and that this hypoxic response may be mediated by {HIF}-1α. Given an emerging role for tumour cell-derived exosomes in tumour progression, this has significant implications for understanding the hypoxic tumour phenotype, whereby hypoxic cancer cells may release more exosomes into their microenvironment to promote their own survival and invasion.},

However, the extent to which genomic signatures are shared across tissues is still unclear. We performed an integrative analysis using five genome-wide platforms and one proteomic platform on 3,527 specimens from 12 cancer types, revealing a unified classification into 11 major subtypes. Five subtypes were nearly identical to their tissue-of-origin counterparts, but several distinct cancer types were found to converge into common subtypes. Lung squamous, head and neck, and a subset of bladder cancers coalesced into one subtype typified by {TP}53 alterations, {TP}63 amplifications, and high expression of immune and proliferation pathway genes. Of note, bladder cancers split into three pan-cancer subtypes. The multiplatform classification, while correlated with tissue-of-origin, provides independent information for predicting clinical outcomes.

	abstract = {{MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Although {miRNAs} can function as both tumour suppressors and oncogenes in tumour development, a widespread downregulation of {miRNAs} is commonly observed in human cancers and promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. This indicates an inherent significance of small {RNAs} in tumour suppression. However, the connection between tumour suppressor networks and {miRNA} biogenesis machineries has not been investigated in depth. Here we show that a central tumour suppressor, p53, enhances the post-transcriptional maturation of several {miRNAs} with growth-suppressive function, including {miR}-16-1, {miR}-143 and {miR}-145, in response to {DNA} damage. In {HCT}116 cells and human diploid fibroblasts, p53 interacts with the Drosha processing complex through the association with {DEAD}-box {RNA} helicase p68 (also known as {DDX}5) and facilitates the processing of primary {miRNAs} to precursor {miRNAs}. We also found that transcriptionally inactive p53 mutants interfere with a functional assembly between Drosha complex and p68, leading to attenuation of {miRNA} processing activity. These findings suggest that transcription-independent modulation of {miRNA} biogenesis is intrinsically embedded in a tumour suppressive program governed by p53. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of p53 in {miRNA} processing, which may underlie key aspects of cancer biology.},

So far, no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of the disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we report here an integrated analysis of 131 urothelial carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations. There were statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32 genes, including multiple genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, chromatin regulation, and kinase signalling pathways, as well as 9 genes not previously reported as significantly mutated in any cancer. {RNA} sequencing revealed four expression subtypes, two of which (papillary-like and basal/squamous-like) were also evident in {microRNA} sequencing and protein data. Whole-genome and {RNA} sequencing identified recurrent in-frame activating {FGFR}3–{TACC}3 fusions and expression or integration of several viruses (including {HPV}16) that are associated with gene inactivation. Our analyses identified potential therapeutic targets in 69\% of the tumours, including 42\% with targets in the phosphatidylinositol-3-{OH} kinase/{AKT}/{mTOR} pathway and 45\% with targets (including {ERBB}2) in the {RTK}/{MAPK} pathway. Chromatin regulatory genes were more frequently mutated in urothelial carcinoma than in any other common cancer studied so far, indicating the future possibility of targeted therapy for chromatin abnormalities.},

To discover the {microRNAs} regulating this critical transition, we used 80 biopsies from invasive ductal carcinoma, 8 from ductal carcinoma in situ, and 6 from normal breast. We selected them from a recently published deep-sequencing dataset [Farazi {TA}, et al. (2011) Cancer Res 71:4443–4453]. The {microRNA} profile established for the normal breast to ductal carcinoma in situ transition was largely maintained in the in situ to invasive ductal carcinoma transition. Nevertheless, a nine-{microRNA} signature was identified that differentiated invasive from in situ carcinoma. Specifically, let-7d, {miR}-210, and -221 were down-regulated in the in situ and up-regulated in the invasive transition, thus featuring an expression reversal along the cancer progression path. Additionally, we identified {microRNAs} for overall survival and time to metastasis. Five noncoding genes were associated with both prognostic signatures—{miR}-210, -21, -106b*, -197, and let-7i, with {miR}-210 the only one also involved in the invasive transition. To pinpoint critical cellular functions affected in the invasive transition, we identified the protein coding genes with inversely related profiles to {miR}-210: {BRCA}1, {FANCD}, {FANCF}, {PARP}1, E-cadherin, and Rb1 were all activated in the in situ and down-regulated in the invasive carcinoma. Additionally, we detected differential splicing isoforms with special features, including a truncated {EGFR} lacking the kinase domain and overexpressed only in ductal carcinoma in situ.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Microparticles are cellular-derived vesicles (0.5-1.0 μm) composed of cell membrane components, which are actively shed from the surface of various cells, including epithelial cells. We compared microparticles in ascites between women with ovarian carcinoma and women with benign ovarian pathology, and isolated tumor-derived (epithelial cell adhesion molecule [{EpCAM}]-positive) microparticles for functional analysis and proteomics.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Cases included 8 patients with benign ovarian neoplasms and 41 with ovarian carcinoma. Ascites from a high-grade stage {III} serous carcinoma was used for functional and proteomic analysis. Cancer cells were isolated using {EpCAM}-coated beads, microparticles were isolated by ultracentrifugation/flow cytometry, and sorting was achieved using markers (eg, {EpCAM}). Binding and migrations assays were performed with 3 ovarian cancer cell lines. Proteomic analysis of {EpCAM}-positive microparticles and ascites cancer cells was performed by mass spectrometry.
{RESULTS}: Microparticles in benign pelvic fluid were similar to early and advanced-stage ascites (2.4 vs 2.8 vs 2.0 × 10⁶ microparticles/{mL}). Advanced stage had a greater proportion of {EpCAM}-positive microparticles than early or benign disease (13.3\% vs 2.5\% vs 2.1\%; P = 0.001), and serous histology had more than endometrioid (13.2\% vs 1.8\%; P = 0.01). Microparticles bound to the surface of 3 cultured cell lines, and were internalized into the {EpCAM}-positive microparticles, resulting in more cell migration than buffer alone or {EpCAM}-negative microparticles (P = 0.007). A dose-dependent increase was seen with increasing numbers of {EpCAM}-positive microparticles. Proteomics revealed that most proteins in {EPCAM}-positive microparticles were shared with cancer cells, and many are associated with cell motility and invasion, such as fibronectin, filamin A, vimentin, myosin-9, and fibrinogen.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Ascites from advanced-stage and serous ovarian carcinomas contain large numbers of tumor-derived microparticles. In vitro, these microparticles bind to cancer cells and stimulate migration. Tumor-derived microparticles in ascites could mediate the predilection for peritoneal spread in serous ovarian carcinomas.},

However, macrophage infiltration and local biomarkers of inflammation in breast adipose tissue have seldom been studied in association with obesity. Gene expression profiles of normal breast tissue from reduction mammoplasty patients were evaluated by whole genome microarrays to identify patterns associated with obesity status (normal-weight, body mass index ({BMI}) {\textless}25; overweight, {BMI} 25-29.9; obese, {BMI} ≥30). The presence of macrophage-enriched inflammatory loci with immunopositivity for {CD}68 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry ({IHC}). After adjusting for confounding by age, 760 genes were differentially expressed (203 up and 557 down; {FDR} = 0.026) between normal-weight and obese women. Gene ontology analysis suggested significant enrichment for pathways involving {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {CCR}5 signaling in macrophages and {RXRα} and {PPARα} activation, consistent with a pro-inflammatory state and suggestive of macrophage infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis also demonstrated that the genomic signatures of monocytes and macrophages were over-represented in the obese group with {FDR} of 0.08 and 0.13, respectively. Increased macrophage infiltration was confirmed by {IHC}, which showed that the breast adipose tissue of obese women had higher average macrophage counts (mean = 8.96 vs. 3.56 in normal-weight women) and inflammatory foci counts (mean = 4.91 vs. 2.67 in normal-weight women).

	abstract = {Animal models play a major role in understanding the etiology, molecular mechanisms, strategizing intervention and treatment of human diseases. {ACI}, an inbred line derived from August and Copenhagen strains, is unique for its susceptibility to estrogen-induced mammary tumors. Histologically and in many molecular aspects, the tumors formed in these rats are similar to human breast cancers. Previous studies have shown high mortality and significant weight loss in this model associated with pituitary gland abnormality. We hypothesized that this could be due to overwhelming the biological system with estrogen. Three groups of female {ACI} rats (7-8 weeks) received either 3-cm sham silastic implants, or the conventional 3-cm silastic implants containing 27 mg of 17beta-estradiol, or 1.2-cm silastic implants containing 9 mg 17beta-estradiol. The sham and 3-cm implant rats were euthanized at 180 days while the 1.2-cm implant rats were euthanized at 240 days. The 1.2-cm implants resulted in significantly reduced serum estrogen levels and pituitary gland size. Animals with 1.2-cm implants had 100\% tumor incidence, while not all rats developed tumors with 3-cm implants. Both the tumor burden (from 1,011+/-402 to 2,324+/-454 mm(3); p=0.01) and tumor multiplicity (from 5.78+/-1.4 to 7.6+/-1.04) increased by lowering the estrogen dose, and the inter-animal variability in the tumor indices decreased. Finally, the weight of the pituitary gland was also significantly (p=0.0004) reduced (from 178+/-23.5 mg to 80+/-8.9 mg) and the mortality rate decreased from 42\% to 0\% (p=0.01). Our data indicate that the improvised model will provide valuable insights into the molecular alterations in the estrogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis and will be ideal for inhibition studies.},

We analyzed the functional coverage of this collection and we designed a context-sensitive search algorithm for rapid exploration of the compendium. A researcher using our system provides a small set of query genes to establish a biological search context; based on this query, we weight each dataset’s relevance to the context, and within these weighted datasets we identify additional genes that are co-expressed with the query set. Our method exhibits an average increase in accuracy of 273\% compared to previous mega-clustering approaches when recapitulating known biology. Further, we find that our search paradigm identifies novel biological predictions that can be verified through further experimentation. Our methodology provides the ability for biological researchers to explore the totality of existing microarray data in a manner useful for drawing conclusions and formulating hypotheses, which we believe is invaluable for the research community. {AVAILABILITY}: Our query-driven search engine, called {SPELL}, is available at http://function.princeton.edu/{SPELL}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Several additional data files, figures and discussions are available at http://function.princeton.edu/{SPELL}/supplement.},

	abstract = {In breast cancer, metastases are relatively widely distributed, with the most common sites being bone, regional lymph nodes, lung, liver, and brain. The detailed mechanism of organ-specific metastasis is poorly understood. In this study, we initiated a search for genes that are implicated in brain or bone metastasis of primary human breast cancer. We generated gene expression profiles of 18 brain and eight bone metastases derived from primary breast tumors. We identified 73 genes differentially expressed between brain and bone metastases. Visualization of the differential gene expression profiles by correspondence and cluster analyses shows that the metastases clearly separate into two distinct groups as an exact reflection of their site of metastasis. Moreover, the analysis of this gene set in primary breast tumors relapsing to either bone or brain allowed accurate categorization of the tumors according to their metastatic site. The identified genes may prove to be excellent markers to predict the site of metastasis in breast cancer patients and could lead to tailor-made therapy to an individual patient.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Tumor-associated macrophages ({TAMs}) are alternatively activated cells induced by interleukin-4 ({IL}-4)-releasing {CD}4+ T cells. {TAMs} promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis; however, the mechanisms underlying these interactions between macrophages and tumor cells that lead to cancer metastasis remain elusive. Previous studies have found {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) circulating in the peripheral blood and have identified microvesicles, or exosomes, as mediators of cell-cell communication. Therefore, one alternative mechanism for the promotion of breast cancer cell invasion by {TAMs} may be through macrophage-secreted exosomes, which would deliver invasion-potentiating {miRNAs} to breast cancer cells.
{RESULTS}: We utilized a co-culture system with {IL}-4-activated macrophages and breast cancer cells to verify that {miRNAs} are transported from macrophages to breast cancer cells. The shuttling of fluorescently-labeled exogenous {miRNAs} from {IL}-4-activated macrophages to co-cultivated breast cancer cells without direct cell-cell contact was observed. {miR}-223, a {miRNA} specific for {IL}-4-activated macrophages, was detected within the exosomes released by macrophages and was significantly elevated in the co-cultivated {SKBR}3 and {MDA}-{MB}-231 cells. The invasiveness of the co-cultivated breast cancer cells decreased when the {IL}-4-activated macrophages were treated with a {miR}-223 antisense oligonucleotide ({ASO}) that would inhibit {miR}-223 expression. Furthermore, results from a functional assay revealed that {miR}-223 promoted the invasion of breast cancer cells via the Mef2c-β-catenin pathway.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We conclude that macrophages regulate the invasiveness of breast cancer cells through exosome-mediated delivery of oncogenic {miRNAs}. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the metastasis-promoting interactions between macrophages and breast cancer cells.},

However, parallel factor analysis ({PARAFAC}) and Tucker-3 methods could be a better choice. To evaluate the methods, preference maps of sweet corn varieties will be introduced.
{RESULTS}: A preference map of eight sweet corn varieties was established using {PARAFAC} and Tucker-3 methods. Instrumental data were also integrated into the maps. The triplot created by the {PARAFAC} model explains better how odour is separated from texture or appearance, and how some varieties are separated from others.
{CONCLUSION}: Internal and external preference maps were created using parallel factor analysis ({PARAFAC}) and Tucker-3 models employing both sensory (trained panel and consumers) and instrumental parameters simultaneously. Triplots of the applied three-way models have a competitive advantage compared to the traditional biplots of the {PCA}-based external preference maps. The solution of {PARAFAC} and Tucker-3 is very similar regarding the interpretation of the first and third factors. The main difference is due to the second factor as it differentiated the attributes better. Consumers who prefer 'super sweet' varieties (they place great emphasis especially on taste) are much younger and have significantly higher incomes, and buy sweet corn products rarely (once a month). Consumers who consume sweet corn products mainly because of their texture and appearance are significantly older and include a higher ratio of men.},

We hypothesized that changes in gene expression profiles within the histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium of {BRCA}1 mutation carriers would overlap with the expression profiles in {BRCA}1-mutated ovarian carcinomas and represent a {BRCA}1 preneoplastic signature. Laser capture microdissection of frozen sections was used to isolate neoplastic cells or histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium, and expression profiles were generated on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 gene expression arrays. Normal-risk controls were 11 women wild type for {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 ({WT}-{FT}). {WT}-{FT} were compared with histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium from seven women with deleterious {BRCA}1 mutations who had foci of at least intraepithelial neoplasm within their fallopian tube (B1-{FTocc}). {WT}-{FT} samples were also compared with 12 {BRCA}1 ovarian carcinomas (B1-{CA}). The comparison of {WT}-{FT} versus B1-{FTocc} resulted in 152 differentially expressed probe sets, and the comparison of {WT}-{FT} versus B1-{CA} resulted in 4079 differentially expressed probe sets. The {BRCA}1 preneoplastic signature was composed of the overlap between these two lists, which included 41 concordant probe sets. Genes in the {BRCA}1 preneoplastic signature included several known tumor suppressor genes such as {CDKN}1C and {EFEMP}1 and several thought to be important in invasion and metastasis such as E2F3.

	abstract = {Purpose: Lymphocytic infiltration of tumors predicts improved survival in breast cancer patients. Previous studies have suggested that this survival benefit is confined predominantly to the basal-like subtype. Immune infiltration in ovarian tumors is also associated with improved prognosis. Currently, it is unclear what aspects of the immune response mediate this improved outcome. Experimental Design: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) {mRNA}-seq data and a large microarray data set, we evaluated adaptive immune gene expression by genomic subtype in breast and ovarian cancer. To investigate B-cells observed to be prognostic within specific subtypes, we developed methods to analyze B-cell population diversity and degree of somatic hypermutation ({SHM}) from B-cell receptor ({BCR}) sequences in {mRNA}-seq data. Results: Improved metastasis-free/progression-free survival was correlated with B-cell gene expression signatures, which were restricted mainly to the basal-like and {HER}2-enriched breast cancer subtypes and the immunoreactive ovarian cancer subtype. Consistent with a restricted epitope-driven response, a subset of basal-like and {HER}2-enriched breast tumors and immunoreactive ovarian tumors showed high expression of a low-diversity population of {BCR} gene segments. More {BCR} segments showed improved prognosis with increased expression in basal-like breast tumors and immunoreactive ovarian tumors compared with other subtypes. Basal-like and {HER}2-enriched tumors exhibited more {BCR} sequence variants in regions consistent with somatic hypermutation. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest the presence of a productive and potentially restricted anti-tumor B-cell response in basal-like breast and immunoreactive ovarian cancers. Immunomodulatory therapies that support B-cell responses may be a promising therapeutic approach to targeting these B-cell infiltrated tumors.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular environment by various types of cells, including tumor cells.

Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) possess the potential for differentiation into multilineages and can also function as precursors for tumor stroma including myofibroblast that provides a favorable environment for tumor progression. Although a close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a neoplastic tumor microenvironment has already been revealed, how this communication works is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of tumor cell-derived exosomes on {MSCs} by treating adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}) with breast cancer-derived exosomes. The exosome-treated {ADSCs} exhibited the phenotypes of tumor-associated myofibroblasts with increased expression of α-{SMA}. Exosome treatment also induced increased expression of tumor-promoting factors {SDF}-1, {VEGF}, {CCL}5 and {TGFβ}. This phenomenon was correlated with increased expression of {TGFβ} receptor I and {II}. Analysis of {SMAD}2, a key player in the {TGFβ} receptor-mediated {SMAD} pathway, revealed that its phosphorylation was increased by exosome treatment and was inhibited by treatment with {SB}431542, an inhibitor of the {SMAD}-mediated pathway, resulting in decreased expression of α-{SMA}. Taken together, our results show that tumor-derived exosomes induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} via the {SMAD}-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that tumor-derived exosomes can contribute to progression and malignancy of tumor cells by converting {MSCs} within tumor stroma into tumor-associated myofibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.},

Although no knowledge of patient survival or outcomes was used to derive these gene descriptions, these different classes based upon patterns of gene expression have important prognostic implications. Predictive markers in estrogen receptor-negative and triple-negative disease will be particularly important because in the absence of therapy, these tumor subtypes tend to have a poor prognosis. In addition, the claudin-low subgroup has been found to be common within the triple-negative cancers and may have further prognostic and therapeutic implications. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer do benefit from chemotherapy, but better treatment options are needed that are less toxic, reduce the risk of disease progression, and are more targeted to this patient population. Potential treatments include poly ({ADP}-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, and therapies that target cancer stem cells could also have an important impact in these patients.

	abstract = {The discovery of {microRNAs} ({miRNAs} - small non-coding {RNAs} of approximately 22 nt) heralded a new and exciting era in biology. During this period {miRNAs} have gone from ignominy due to their origin mainly in 'junk {DNA}' to notoriety where they can be at once characterized as being all powerful (a single {miRNA} can target and potentially silence several hundred genes) and yet marginal (a given gene can be targeted by several {miRNAs} such that a given {miRNA} typically exerts a modest repression) [1-4]. The emerging paradox is exemplified by {miRNAs} that are prominently expressed in embryonic stem ({ES}) cells. The collective importance of {miRNAs} is firmly established by the fact that Dicer-/- mouse embryos die on day 7.5 due to defects in differentiation [5]. However, oppositely correlated expression that is expected of conventional repressors is increasingly being defied in multiple systems in relation to {miRNA}-{mRNA} target pairs. This is most evident in {ES} cells where {miR}-290-295 and 302 clusters the most abundant {ES} cell {miRNAs} are found to be driven by pluripotency genes Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 and also target these genes in 'incoherent feed-forward loops' [7]. Here the {miRNAs} are co-expressed and positively correlated with these targets that they repress suggesting that one of their primary roles is to fine tune gene expression rather than act as {ON}/{OFF} switches. On the other hand, let-7 family members that are notably low in {ES} cells and rapidly induced upon differentiation exhibit more conventional anti-correlated expression patterns with their targets [7-8]. In an intricately designed auto-regulatory loop, {LIN}28, a key 'keeper' of the pluripotent state binds and represses the processing of let-7 (a key 'keeper' of the differentiated state) [9-11]. One of the let-7 family members, let-7g targets and represses {LIN}28 through four 3'-{UTR} binding sites [12]. We propose that {LIN}28/let-7 pair has the potential to act as a 'toggle switch' that balances the decision to maintain pluripotency vs. differentiation. We also propose that the c-Myc/E2F driven {miR}17-92 cluster that together controls the G1 to S transition is fundamental for {ES} self-renewal and cell proliferation [13-18]. In that context it is no surprise that {LIN}28 and c-Myc (and therefore let-7 and {miR}-17-92 by association) and more recently Oct4/Sox2 regulated {miR}-302 has been shown to be among a handful of factors shown to be necessary and sufficient to convert differentiated cells to induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cells [19-29]. It is also no surprise that activation of {miR}-17-92 ({OncomiRs}) and down-regulation of let-7 (tumor suppressors) is a recurring theme in relation to cancers from multiple systems [30-48]. We speculate that the {LIN}28/let-7; c-{MYC}-E2F/{miR}-17-92 and Oct4/Sox2/{miR}-302-cyclin D1 networks are fundamental to properties of pluripotency and self-renewal associated with embryonic stem cells. We also speculate that {ES} cell {miRNA}-{mRNA} associations may also regulate tissue homeostasis and regeneration in the fully developed adult. Consequently, the appropriate regulation of {LIN}28/let-7; c-{MYC}-E2F/{miR}-17-92 and Oct4/Sox2/{miR}-302-cyclin D1 gene networks will be critical for the success of regenerative strategies that involve {iPS} cells. Any perturbation in key {ES} cell {miRNA}-{mRNA} networks during any of the above processes maybe a hallmark of ({CSCs}).},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Eukaryotic gene expression ({GE}) is subjected to precisely coordinated multi-layer controls, across the levels of epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Recently, the emerging multi-dimensional genomic dataset has provided unprecedented opportunities to study the cross-layer regulatory interplay. In these datasets, the same set of samples is profiled on several layers of genomic activities, e.g. copy number variation ({CNV}), {DNA} methylation ({DM}), {GE} and {microRNA} expression ({ME}). However, suitable analysis methods for such data are currently sparse.
{RESULTS}: In this article, we introduced a sparse Multi-Block Partial Least Squares ({sMBPLS}) regression method to identify multi-dimensional regulatory modules from this new type of data. A multi-dimensional regulatory module contains sets of regulatory factors from different layers that are likely to jointly contribute to a local 'gene expression factory'. We demonstrated the performance of our method on the simulated data as well as on The Cancer Genomic Atlas Ovarian Cancer datasets including the {CNV}, {DM}, {ME} and {GE} data measured on 230 samples. We showed that majority of identified modules have significant functional and transcriptional enrichment, higher than that observed in modules identified using only a single type of genomic data. Our network analysis of the modules revealed that the {CNV}, {DM} and {microRNA} can have coupled impact on expression of important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

	abstract = {Based on the observation that diabetes, obesity, and hypogonadism influence bone metabolism, the existence of a feedback loop and a common regulation was postulated and an endocrine role ascribed to the skeleton. In the first part of this review, two pathways are described whereby adipose tissue acts on bone mass. In the first, leptin activates the sympathetic nervous system via serotonin and diminishes bone mass accrual. The second pathway functions via the activation of {CART} ({CARTPT}) and inhibits bone resorption. The first pathway leads to a decrease in bioactivity of the osteoblast-produced hormone osteocalcin ({OC}) (part 2). In its undercarboxylated form, {OC} acts on the three targets pancreas, adipose tissue, and gonads (part 3) and thereby causes an increase in insulin secretion and sensitivity, β-cell proliferation, and male fertility. Insulin (part 4) is part of a recently discovered regulatory feedback loop between pancreas and osteoblasts. It is a strong counterplayer of leptin as it causes a decrease in {OPG} expression and enhances bone resorption and {OC} decarboxylation. Numerous clinical studies (part 5) have shown associations of total and undercarboxylated {OC} and markers of energy metabolism. Interventional studies, to date only performed in murine models, have shown positive effects of {OC} administration on energy metabolism. Whether bone tissue has an even further-reaching endocrine role remains to be elucidated.},

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by {DNA} microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ({ALL}) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

	abstract = {Long non-coding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) are emerging as potent regulators of cell physiology, and recent studies highlight their role in tumor development. However, while established protein-coding oncogenes and tumor suppressors often display striking patterns of focal {DNA} copy-number alteration in tumors, similar evidence is largely lacking for {lncRNAs}. Here, we report on a genomic analysis of {GENCODE} {lncRNAs} in high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) molecular profiles. Using genomic copy-number data and deep coverage transcriptome sequencing, we derived dual copy-number and expression data for 10,419 {lncRNAs} across 407 primary tumors. We describe global correlations between {lncRNA} copy-number and expression, and associate established expression subtypes with distinct {lncRNA} signatures. By examining regions of focal copy-number change that lack protein-coding targets, we identified an intergenic {lncRNA} on chromosome 1, {OVAL}, that shows narrow focal genomic amplification in a subset of tumors. While weakly expressed in most tumors, focal amplification coincided with strong {OVAL} transcriptional activation. Screening of 16 other cancer types revealed similar patterns in serous endometrial carcinomas. This shows that intergenic {lncRNAs} can be specifically targeted by somatic copy-number amplification, suggestive of functional involvement in tumor initiation or progression. Our analysis provides testable hypotheses and paves the way for further study of {lncRNAs} based on {TCGA} and other large-scale cancer genomics datasets.},

	abstract = {Bone is the most preferred site for metastatic dissemination in breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of a set of antibodies that could serve as predictive biomarkers associated with breast cancer metastasis in a subset of sixteen (16) breast cancer patients who developed bone metastasis. The clinical and pathologic data were obtained, and tissue microarrays were constructed. Tissue microarray slides were stained for {TFF}-1, {CXRC}4, {MMP}1, {PTHrP}, {HER}2, {CD}44, {FGFR}3 and {IL}-11. The expression rates were compared between the metastatic breast cancer to bone ({MBC}-B) group and a group of sixty-four (64) primary breast cancer ({PBC}). The results demonstrated that {MBC}-B group patients were more likely to be {HER}2 positive (P = 0.016). There was no significant difference on estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor expression between {MBC}-B group and {PBC} group (P {\textgreater} 0.05). There was a high expression of {CXCR}4, {MMP}-1, {CD}44, {TFF}-1, {PTHrP}, {FGFR}3 and {IL}-11, in both, {PBC} and {MBC}-B, and no significant differences between the groups were identified. We found that tumors associated with bone metastasis tended to be larger than 2 cm. The high morbidity associated to metastatic breast cancer prompts the identification of predictive biomarkers of relapse of breast tumors to categorize patients at high risk of bone metastasis and serve as targeted therapy.},

Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30-100 nm in diameter) produced by numerous cells. Recently, exosomes have been shown to contain {miRNAs}. However, the small {RNAs} contained in exosomes are not fully characterized. In a previous study, we found at least two types of salivary exosome that are different in size and have different proteomes. Studies of salivary exosomal small {RNAs} are limited to {miRNAs}. In this study, we examined small {RNA} transcriptomes using next generation sequencing technology to elucidate a full transcriptome set of small {RNAs} expressed in the two types of salivary exosomes and in whole saliva ({WS}). Many types of small {RNA}, such as {miRNA}, piwi-interacting {RNA} ({piRNA}), small nucleolar {RNA} ({snoRNA}) and other small {RNAs} are contained in salivary exosomes and {WS}.

Recent studies have highlighted the critical application of exosomes as personalized targeted drug delivery vehicles and as reservoirs of disease biomarkers. While these research applications have created significant interest and can be translated into practice, the stability of exosomes needs to be assessed and exosome isolation protocols from blood plasma need to be optimized. To optimize methods to isolate exosomes from blood plasma, we performed a comparative evaluation of three exosome isolation techniques (differential centrifugation coupled with ultracentrifugation, epithelial cell adhesion molecule immunoaffinity pull-down, and {OptiPrep}({TM}) density gradient separation) using normal human plasma. Based on {MS}, Western blotting and microscopy results, we found that the {OptiPrep}({TM}) density gradient method was superior in isolating pure exosomal populations, devoid of highly abundant plasma proteins. In addition, we assessed the stability of exosomes in plasma over 90 days under various storage conditions. Western blotting analysis using the exosomal marker, {TSG}101, revealed that exosomes are stable for 90 days. Interestingly, in the context of cellular uptake, the isolated exosomes were able to fuse with target cells revealing that they were indeed biologically active.},

Approximately 500 {miRNA} genes have been identified in the human genome. Their function is largely unknown, but data from worms, flies, fish and mice suggest that they have important roles in animal growth, development, homeostasis and disease. {MiRNA} expression profiles demonstrate that many {miRNAs} are deregulated in human cancers. {MiRNAs} have been shown to regulate oncogenes, tumour suppressors and a number of cancer-related genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis, cell migration and angiogenesis. {MiRNAs} encoded by the mir-17-92 cluster have oncogenic potential and others may act as tumour suppressors. Some {miRNAs} and their target sites were found to be mutated in cancer. {MiRNAs} may have great diagnostic potential for human cancer and even {miRNA}-based cancer therapies may be on the horizon.},

Over the last decade, extensive progress has been made with regard to our understanding of the molecules that regulate skeletal muscle mass. Not surprisingly, many of these molecules are intimately involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and protein degradation [e.g. the mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}), eukaryotic initiation factor 2B ({eIF}2B), eukaryotic initiation factor 3f ({eIF}3f) and the forkhead box O ({FoxO}) transcription factors]. It is also becoming apparent that molecules which sense, or control, the energetic status of the cell play a key role in the regulation of muscle mass [e.g. {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 α ({PGC}1α)]. In this review we will attempt to summarize the current knowledge of how these molecules regulate skeletal muscle mass.},

These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

The modulation of signaling via coinhibitory or costimulatory receptors expressed on T cells has proven to be a potent way to amplify antitumor immune responses. This approach has been exploited successfully for the generation of a new class of anticancer therapies, “checkpoint-blocking” antibodies, exemplified by the recently {FDA}-approved agent, ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks the coinhibitory receptor {CTLA}-4. Capitalizing on the success of ipilimumab, agents that target a second coinhibitory receptor, {PD}-1, or its ligand, {PD}-L1, are in clinical development. Lessons learned from treating patients with {CTLA}-4 and {PD}-1 pathway-blocking antibodies will be reviewed, with a focus on concepts likely to inform the clinical development and application of agents in earlier stages of development.

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18661261},
	doi = {10.1007/s10549-008-0130-2},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

The 70-gene prognosis-signature has shown to be a valid prognostic tool in node-negative breast cancer. Although axillary lymph node status is considered to be one of the most important prognostic factors, still 25-30\% of node-positive breast cancer patients will remain free of distant metastases, even without adjuvant systemic therapy. We therefore investigated whether the 70-gene prognosis-signature can accurately identify patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes who have an excellent disease outcome.


{METHODS}

Frozen tumour samples from 241 patients with operable T1-3 breast cancer, and 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes, with a median follow-up of 7.8 years, were selected from 2 institutes. Using a customized microarray, tumour samples were analysed for the 70-gene tumour expression signature. In addition, we reanalysed part of a previously described cohort (n = 106) with extended follow-up.


{RESULTS}

The 10-year distant metastasis-free ({DMFS}) and breast cancer specific survival ({BCSS}) probabilities were 91\% ({SE} 4\%) and 96\% ({SE} 2\%), respectively for the good prognosis-signature group (99 patients), and 76\% ({SE} 4\%) and 76\% ({SE} 4\%), respectively for the poor prognosis-signature group (142 patients). The 70-gene signature was significantly superior to the traditional prognostic factors in predicting {BCSS} with a multivariate hazard ratio ({HR}) of 7.17 (95\% {CI} 1.81 to 28.43; P = 0.005).


{CONCLUSIONS}

The 70-gene prognosis-signature outperforms traditional prognostic factors in predicting disease outcome in patients with 1-3 positive nodes. Moreover, the signature can accurately identify patients with an excellent disease outcome in node-positive breast cancer, who may be safely spared adjuvant chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {The development of human cancers is a multistep process in which normal cells acquire characteristics that ultimately lead to their conversion into cancer cells. Many obstacles must be overcome for this process to occur; of these obstacles, is the ability to survive an inhospitable microenvironment. It is recognized that the intercommunication between tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment is essential to overcoming this obstacle and for the tumor to progress, metastasize and establish itself at distant sites. Exosomes are membrane-derived vesicles that have recently been recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication, as they carry lipids, proteins, {mRNAs} and {microRNAs} that can be transferred to a recipient cell via fusion of the exosome with the target cell membrane. In the context of cancer cells, this process entails the transfer of cancer-promoting cellular contents to surrounding cells within the tumor microenvironment or into the circulation to act at distant sites, thereby enabling cancer progression. In this process, the transfer of exosomal {microRNAs} to a recipient cell where they can regulate target gene expression is of particular interest, both in understanding the basic biology of cancer progression and for the development of therapeutic approaches. This review discusses the exosome-mediated intercellular communication via {microRNAs} within the tumor microenvironment in human cancers, with a particular focus on breast cancer exosomes.},

	abstract = {It is now accepted that breast cancer is not a single disease, but instead it is composed of a spectrum of tumor subtypes with distinct cellular origins, somatic changes, and etiologies. Gene expression profiling using {DNA} microarrays has contributed significantly to our understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of breast tumor formation, progression, and recurrence. For example, at least two clinical diagnostic assays exist (i.e., {OncotypeDX} {RS} and Mammaprint®) that are able to predict outcome in patients using patterns of gene expression and predetermined mathematical algorithms. In addition, a new molecular taxonomy based upon the inherent, or "intrinsic," biology of breast tumors has been developed; this taxonomy is called the "intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer," which now identifies five distinct tumor types and a normal breast-like group. Importantly, the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer predict patient relapse, overall survival, and response to endocrine and chemotherapy regimens. Thus, most of the clinical behavior of a breast tumor is already written in its subtype profile. Here, we describe the discovery and basic biology of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, and detail how this interacts with underlying genetic alternations, response to therapy, and the metastatic process.},

	abstract = {{MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) are a family of 19-24 nucleotide non-coding {RNAs} with posttranscriptional regulatory functions. The involvement of {miRNAs} in normal hematopoiesis implies that deregulated {miRNAs} might contribute to leukemogenesis. To date, although certain {miRNAs} have been established a clear oncogenic role in hematological malignancies, other individual {miRNAs} potentially involved in human leukemogenesis still remain elusive. In this report, we showed that {miR}-142-3p was upregulated in human T-leukemic cell lines and primary T-leukemic cells isolated from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-{ALL}) patients and its expressive levels were correlated with patients' prognosis. Such an oncogenic role of {miR}-142-3p could be explained by its targeting cyclic adenosine monophosphate ({cAMP})/protein kinase A ({PKA}) and glucocorticoid receptor alpha ({GRα}). High levels of {miR}-142-3p resulted in low levels of {cAMP} and weak activity of {PKA}, thus relieving the inhibitory effect of {PKA} on T-leukemic cell proliferation. Meanwhile, {miR}-142-3p decreased {GRα} protein expression by directly targeting the 3'-untranslational region of {GRα} {mRNA}, leading to glucocorticoid resistance. Transfection of the {miR}-142-3p inhibitor effectively converted glucocorticoid resistance, because of the resultant increase of {GRα} expression and {PKA} activity. These findings suggest that {miR}-142-3p is critical in T-cell leukemogenesis and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in T-{ALL} patients.},

In general, similar differences were observed among women diagnosed at age 30-49 years. Inflammatory carcinomas are associated with more aggressive tumour phenotypes, and mucinous, tubular, and papillary tumours are associated with less aggressive phenotypes.

The aim of this study was to validate two different signatures; {ClearCode}34, a 34-gene signature model (Brooks et al. Eur Urol., 2014) and an 8-gene signature model (Choudhury et al. Eur Urol., 2015) in a population of {mRCC}. Methods: {mRCC} patients from five institutions who were part of {TCGA} {KIRC} were identified and clinical data were retrieved. Normalized {RNAseq} gene expression data were downloaded from the public {TCGA} portal. {mRCC} patients were dichotomized to good and poor prognostic risk groups using the 2 models. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to investigate an association between molecular subtype and overall survival ({OS}) from first-line therapy. Results:  Overall, 56 patients were included in the analysis. Median age was 62 years. The proportions of patients in {IMDC} prognostic risk groups were 14\%, 66\%, and 20\% for good, intermediate, and poor risk respectively. Fifty two (92.8\%) patients received {VEGF}-targeted therapy. Median follow-up from initiation of first-line therapy was 25.2 months. Applying the {ClearCode}34, median survival for the {ccA} (n = 18) and {ccB} (n = 38) subtypes were 27.6 and 22.3 months ({HR}: 2.33; 95\% {CI}, 1.02 to 5.31; P = 0.03), respectively. On multivariable analyses and adjusting for {IMDC} groups, {ccB} remained independly associated with a worse {OS} (p = 0.044). On the other hand, the 8-gene signature molecular subtypes did not predict survival in this cohort ({HR} 1.76; 95\% {CI}, 0.8 to 3.85, P = 0.15). Conclusions:   {ClearCode}34, but not the 8-gene molecular signature model, is prognostic in patients with {mRCC}. These data need to be externally and prospectively validated.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Exosomes are small membrane bound vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosomes contain various functional proteins, {mRNAs} and {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) that could be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Currently, a standard method for serum exosome isolation is differential ultracentrifugation, but a search for alternative, less time-consuming and labour extensive exosomal isolation method for use in clinical settings is ongoing. The effect of serum exosome isolation method on obtained {miRNA} profile is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to determine to which extent selected exosome isolation methods influence the serum exosomal {miRNA} profile.
{DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Exosomes were isolated from blood serum of healthy individuals by ultracentrifugation and {ExoQuick} Precipitation methods. The expression profile of 375 {miRNAs} was determined by real time {PCR} using Exiqon {miRCURY} {LNA}™ {microRNA} Human panel I assays.
{RESULTS}: Although a strong correlation of exosomal {miRNA} profiles was observed between the two isolation methods, distinct clusters of {miRNA} levels between the used methods were identified. The detected levels of two {miRNAs}, {miR}-92a and {miR}-486-5p, were significantly influenced by the exosome isolation method used.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Both exosome isolation methods are suitable for serum exosomal {miRNA} profiling. Differences found in {miRNA} patterns between the two methods indicate that the observed exosomal {miRNA} profile is slightly affected by the extracellular vesicle isolation method.},

Unfortunately, tissue samples used in cancer studies are usually composed of multiple cell types and the non-cancerous portions can significantly affect expression profiles. This severely limits the conclusions that can be made about the specificity of gene expression in the cell-type of interest. However, statistical analysis can be used to identify differentially expressed genes that are related to the biological question being studied.Results: We propose a statistical approach to expression deconvolution from mixed tissue samples in which the proportion of each component cell type is unknown. Our method estimates the proportion of each component in a mixed tissue sample; this estimate can be used to provide estimates of gene expression from each component.

	abstract = {Because of the high risk of recurrence in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma ({HGS}-{OvCa}), the development of outcome predictors could be valuable for patient stratification. Using the catalog of The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), we developed subtype and survival gene expression signatures, which, when combined, provide a prognostic model of {HGS}-{OvCa} classification, named "Classification of Ovarian Cancer" ({CLOVAR}). We validated {CLOVAR} on an independent dataset consisting of 879 {HGS}-{OvCa} expression profiles. The worst outcome group, accounting for 23\% of all cases, was associated with a median survival of 23 months and a platinum resistance rate of 63\%, versus a median survival of 46 months and platinum resistance rate of 23\% in other cases. Associating the outcome prediction model with {BRCA}1/{BRCA}2 mutation status, residual disease after surgery, and disease stage further optimized outcome classification. Ovarian cancer is a disease in urgent need of more effective therapies. The spectrum of outcomes observed here and their association with {CLOVAR} signatures suggests variations in underlying tumor biology. Prospective validation of the {CLOVAR} model in the context of additional prognostic variables may provide a rationale for optimal combination of patient and treatment regimens.},

	abstract = {The current histoclinical breast cancer classification is simple but imprecise. Several molecular classifications of breast cancers based on expression profiling have been proposed as alternatives. However, their reliability and clinical utility have been repeatedly questioned, notably because most of them were derived from relatively small initial patient populations. We analyzed the transcriptomes of 537 breast tumors using three unsupervised classification methods. A core subset of 355 tumors was assigned to six clusters by all three methods. These six subgroups overlapped with previously defined molecular classes of breast cancer, but also showed important differences, notably the absence of an {ERBB}2 subgroup and the division of the large luminal {ER}+ group into four subgroups, two of them being highly proliferative. Of the six subgroups, four were {ER}+/{PR}+/{AR}+, one was {ER}-/{PR}-/{AR}+ and one was triple negative ({AR}-/{ER}-/{PR}-). {ERBB}2-amplified tumors were split between the {ER}-/{PR}-/{AR}+ subgroup and the highly proliferative {ER}+ {LumC} subgroup. Importantly, each of these six molecular subgroups showed specific copy-number alterations. Gene expression changes were correlated to specific signaling pathways. Each of these six subgroups showed very significant differences in tumor grade, metastatic sites, relapse-free survival or response to chemotherapy. All these findings were validated on large external datasets including more than 3000 tumors. Our data thus indicate that these six molecular subgroups represent well-defined clinico-biological entities of breast cancer. Their identification should facilitate the detection of novel prognostic factors or therapeutical targets in breast cancer.},

Nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}) was introduced as an unsupervised, parts-based learning paradigm involving the decomposition of a nonnegative matrix V into two nonnegative matrices, W and H, via a multiplicative updates algorithm. In the context of a pxn gene expression matrix V consisting of observations on p genes from n samples, each column of W defines a metagene, and each column of H represents the metagene expression pattern of the corresponding sample. {NMF} has been primarily applied in an unsupervised setting in image and natural language processing. More recently, it has been successfully utilized in a variety of applications in computational biology. Examples include molecular pattern discovery, class comparison and prediction, cross-platform and cross-species analysis, functional characterization of genes and biomedical informatics.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Single sample predictors ({SSPs}) and Subtype classification models ({SCMs}) are gene expression-based classifiers used to identify the four primary molecular subtypes of breast cancer (basal-like, {HER}2-enriched, luminal A, and luminal B). {SSPs} use hierarchical clustering, followed by nearest centroid classification, based on large sets of tumor-intrinsic genes. {SCMs} use a mixture of Gaussian distributions based on sets of genes with expression specifically correlated with three key breast cancer genes (estrogen receptor [{ER}], {HER}2, and aurora kinase A [{AURKA}]). The aim of this study was to compare the robustness, classification concordance, and prognostic value of these classifiers with those of a simplified three-gene {SCM} in a large compendium of microarray datasets.
{METHODS}: Thirty-six publicly available breast cancer datasets (n = 5715) were subjected to molecular subtyping using five published classifiers (three {SSPs} and two {SCMs}) and {SCMGENE}, the new three-gene ({ER}, {HER}2, and {AURKA}) {SCM}. We used the prediction strength statistic to estimate robustness of the classification models, defined as the capacity of a classifier to assign the same tumors to the same subtypes independently of the dataset used to fit it. We used Cohen κ and Cramer V coefficients to assess concordance between the subtype classifiers and association with clinical variables, respectively. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and cross-validated partial likelihood to compare prognostic value of the resulting classifications. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: {SCMs} were statistically significantly more robust than {SSPs}, with {SCMGENE} being the most robust because of its simplicity. {SCMGENE} was statistically significantly concordant with published {SCMs} (κ = 0.65-0.70) and {SSPs} (κ = 0.34-0.59), statistically significantly associated with {ER} (V = 0.64), {HER}2 (V = 0.52) status, and histological grade (V = 0.55), and yielded similar strong prognostic value.
{CONCLUSION}: Our results suggest that adequate classification of the major and clinically relevant molecular subtypes of breast cancer can be robustly achieved with quantitative measurements of three key genes.},

We propose an unsupervised method that take into account both co-expression dynamics and network topological information to simultaneously infer network modules and phenotype conditions in which they are activated or de-activated. Using our method, we have discovered network modules specific to cancer or subtypes of cancers. Many of these modules are consistent with or supported by their functional annotations or their previously known involvement in cancer. In particular, we identified a module that is predominately activated in breast cancer and is involved in tumor suppression. While individual components of this module have been suggested to be associated with tumor suppression, their coordinated function has never been elucidated. Here by adopting a network perspective, we have identified their interrelationships and, particularly, a hub gene {PDGFRL} that may play an important role in this tumor suppressor network. {CONCLUSION}: Using a network-based approach, our method provides new insights into the complex cellular mechanisms that characterize cancer and cancer subtypes. By incorporating co-expression dynamics information, our approach can not only extract more functionally homogeneous modules than those based solely on network topology, but also reveal pathway coordination beyond co-expression.},

	abstract = {Exosome secretion is a notable feature of malignancy owing to the roles of these nanoparticles in cancer growth, immune suppression, tumor angiogenesis and therapeutic resistance. Exosomes are 30-100 nm membrane vesicles released by many cells types during normal physiological processes. Tumors aberrantly secrete large quantities of exosomes that transport oncoproteins and immune suppressive molecules to support tumor growth and metastasis. The role of exosomes in intercellular signaling is exemplified by human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ({HER}2) over-expressing breast cancer, where exosomes with the {HER}2 oncoprotein stimulate tumor growth and interfere with the activity of the therapeutic antibody Herceptin®. Since numerous observations from experimental model systems point toward an important clinical impact of exosomes in cancer, several pharmacological strategies have been proposed for targeting their malignant activities. We also propose a novel device strategy involving extracorporeal hemofiltration of exosomes from the entire circulatory system using an affinity plasmapheresis platform known as the Aethlon {ADAPT}™ (adaptive dialysis-like affinity platform technology) system, which would overcome the risks of toxicity and drug interactions posed by pharmacological approaches. This technology allows affinity agents, including exosome-binding lectins and antibodies, to be immobilized in the outer-capillary space of plasma filtration membranes that integrate into existing kidney dialysis systems. Device therapies that evolve from this platform allow rapid extracorporeal capture and selective retention of target particles {\textless} 200 nm from the entire circulatory system. This strategy is supported by clinical experience in hepatitis C virus-infected patients using an {ADAPT}™ device, the Hemopurifier®, to reduce the systemic load of virions having similar sizes and glycosylated surfaces as cancer exosomes. This review discusses the possible therapeutic approaches for targeting immune suppressive exosomes in cancer patients, and the anticipated significance of these strategies for reversing immune dysfunction and improving responses to standard of care treatments.},

In this study, we use penalized latent variable regression methods for joint modeling of multiple omics data types to identify common latent variables that can be used to cluster patient samples into biologically and clinically relevant disease subtypes. We consider lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005), and fused lasso (Tibshirani et al., 2005) methods to induce sparsity in the coefficient vectors, revealing important genomic features that have significant contributions to the latent variables. An iterative ridge regression is used to compute the sparse coefficient vectors. In model selection, a uniform design (Fang and Wang, 1994) is used to seek "experimental" points that scattered uniformly across the search domain for efficient sampling of tuning parameter combinations. We compared our method to sparse singular value decomposition ({SVD}) and penalized Gaussian mixture model ({GMM}) using both real and simulated data sets.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule ({ALCAM}, {CD}166) is a cell membrane protein that is aberrantly expressed in different tumors, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ({PNET}). The aim of this study was to determine the expression of {ALCAM} in {PNET} to learn more about the prevalence and clinical significance of {ALCAM} expression in {PNET}.


{METHODS}

Primary tumors (n = 38) and corresponding lymph node (n = 5) and liver metastases (n = 9) of patients with {PNET}, treated at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf between 1993 and 2006, were analyzed via {ALCAM} immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format. The results were correlated with clinical and histopathologic data, including the {WHO} classification of {PNET}.


{RESULTS}

The majority of primary (74\%) and secondary (50\%) lesions of {PNET} showed strong {ALCAM} expression. Immunohistochemistry of primary tumors revealed an association between high {ALCAM} expression and the hormone production status of the tumor (P = 0.037), and an inverse correlation with metastasis status (P = 0.041) and tumor size (cut off level 2 cm, P = 0.013). Elevated {ALCAM} expression was a significant positive prognostic factor for recurrence-free (P = 0.002) and disease-specific survival (P = 0.009) in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (log rank test).


{CONCLUSIONS}

{ALCAM} is abundantly expressed in {PNET} and decreased expression is significantly associated with poor prognosis. {ALCAM} may be a potential marker for risk prediction in patients diagnosed with {PNET}. Further studies with larger patient collectives are required to validate the results of this study and investigate the functional role of {ALCAM} in {PNET}.},

	abstract = {A major goal in translational cancer research is to identify biological signatures driving cancer progression and metastasis. A common technique applied in genomics research is to cluster patients using gene expression data from a candidate prognostic gene set, and if the resulting clusters show statistically significant outcome stratification, to associate the gene set with prognosis, suggesting its biological and clinical importance. Recent work has questioned the validity of this approach by showing in several breast cancer data sets that "random" gene sets tend to cluster patients into prognostically variable subgroups. This work suggests that new rigorous statistical methods are needed to identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets. To address this problem, we developed Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures ({SAPS}) which integrates standard prognostic tests with a new prognostic significance test based on stratifying patients into prognostic subtypes with random gene sets. {SAPS} ensures that a significant gene set is not only able to stratify patients into prognostically variable groups, but is also enriched for genes showing strong univariate associations with patient prognosis, and performs significantly better than random gene sets. We use {SAPS} to perform a large meta-analysis (the largest completed to date) of prognostic pathways in breast and ovarian cancer and their molecular subtypes. Our analyses show that only a small subset of the gene sets found statistically significant using standard measures achieve significance by {SAPS}. We identify new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer and their corresponding molecular subtypes, and we show that prognostic signatures in {ER} negative breast cancer are more similar to prognostic signatures in ovarian cancer than to prognostic signatures in {ER} positive breast cancer. {SAPS} is a powerful new method for deriving robust prognostic biological signatures from clinically annotated genomic datasets.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Genome-wide measures of gene expression can identify patterns of gene activity that subclassify tumours and might provide a better means than is currently available for individual risk assessment in patients with lymph-node-negative breast cancer.


{METHODS}

We analysed, with Affymetrix Human U133a {GeneChips}, the expression of 22000 transcripts from total {RNA} of frozen tumour samples from 286 lymph-node-negative patients who had not received adjuvant systemic treatment.


{FINDINGS}

In a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors ({ER}) and 16 genes for {ER}-negative patients. This signature showed 93\% sensitivity and 48\% specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. The gene profile was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5.67 [95\% {CI} 2.59-12.4]), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5.55 [2.46-12.5]). The 76-gene profile also represented a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in the subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9.60 [2.28-40.5]), 87 postmenopausal patients (4.04 [1.57-10.4]), and 79 patients with tumours of 10-20 mm (14.1 [3.34-59.2]), a group of patients for whom prediction of prognosis is especially difficult.


{INTERPRETATION}

The identified signature provides a powerful tool for identification of patients at high risk of distant recurrence. The ability to identify patients who have a favourable prognosis could, after independent confirmation, allow clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose less aggressive therapeutic options.},

Here we show that genotoxic stress promotes the p53-dependent up-regulation of the homologous {miRNAs} {miR}-192 and {miR}-215. Like {miR}-34a, activation of {miR}-192/215 induces cell cycle arrest, suggesting that multiple {miRNA} families operate in the p53 network. Furthermore, we define a downstream gene expression signature for {miR}-192/215 expression, which includes a number of transcripts that regulate G(1) and G(2) checkpoints. Of these transcripts, 18 transcripts are direct targets of {miR}-192/215, and the observed cell cycle arrest likely results from a cooperative effect among the modulations of these genes by the {miRNAs}. Our results showing a role for {miR}-192/215 in cell proliferation combined with recent observations that these {miRNAs} are underexpressed in primary cancers support the idea that {miR}-192 and {miR}-215 function as tumor suppressors.},

We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression.

We investigated the effects of {RANKL} on cancer cells and the role of tumor-derived {IL}-6 within the bone microenvironment. Using human breast cancer cell lines to induce tumors in the bone of immune-deficient mice, we first determined whether {RANKL} released by cells of the osteoblast lineage directly promotes {IL}-6 expression by cancer cells in-vitro and in-vivo. We then disrupted of {IL}-6 signaling in-vivo either via knock-down of {IL}-6 in tumor cells or through treatment with specific anti-human or anti-mouse {IL}-6 receptor antibodies to investigate the tumor effect. Finally, we tested the effect of {RANK} knockdown in cancer cells on cancer growth. We demonstrate that osteoblast lineage-derived {RANKL} up-regulates secretion of {IL}-6 by breast cancers in-vivo and in-vitro. {IL}-6 in turn induces expression of {RANK} by cancer cells, which sensitizes the tumor to {RANKL} and significantly enhances cancer {IL}-6 release.

	abstract = {Males of advanced age represent a rapidly growing population at risk for prostate cancer. In the contemporary setting of earlier detection, a majority of prostate carcinomas are still clinically localized and often treated using radiation therapy. Our recent studies have shown that premature cellular senescence, rather than apoptosis, accounts for most of the clonogenic death induced by clinically relevant doses of irradiation in prostate cancer cells. We show here that this treatment-induced senescence was associated with a significantly increased release of exosome-like microvesicles. In premature senescence, this novel secretory phenotype was dependent on the activation of p53. In addition, the release of exosome-like microvesicles also increased during proliferative senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts. These data support the hypothesis that senescence, initiated either by telomere attrition (e.g., aging) or {DNA} damage (e.g., radiotherapy), may induce a p53-dependent increase in the biogenesis of exosome-like vesicles. Ultrastructural analysis and {RNA} interference-mediated knockdown of Tsg101 provided significant evidence that the additional exosomes released by prematurely senescent prostate cancer cells were principally derived from multivesicular endosomes. Moreover, these exosomes were enriched in B7-H3 protein, a recently identified diagnostic marker for prostate cancer, and an abundance of what has recently been termed "exosomal shuttle {RNA}." Our findings are consistent with the proposal that exosomes can transfer cargos, with both immunoregulatory potential and genetic information, between cells through a novel mechanism that may be recruited to increase exosome release during accelerated and replicative cellular senescence.},

	abstract = {Protein isoforms produced by alternative splicing ({AS}) of many genes have been implicated in several aspects of cancer genesis and progression. These observations motivated a genome-wide assessment of {AS} in breast cancer. We accomplished this by measuring exon level expression in 31 breast cancer and nonmalignant immortalized cell lines representing luminal, basal, and claudin-low breast cancer subtypes using Affymetrix Human Junction Arrays. We analyzed these data using a computational pipeline specifically designed to detect {AS} with a low false-positive rate. This identified 181 splice events representing 156 genes as candidates for {AS}. Reverse transcription-{PCR} validation of a subset of predicted {AS} events confirmed 90\%. Approximately half of the {AS} events were associated with basal, luminal, or claudin-low breast cancer subtypes. Exons involved in claudin-low subtype-specific {AS} were significantly associated with the presence of evolutionarily conserved binding motifs for the tissue-specific Fox2 splicing factor. Small interfering {RNA} knockdown of Fox2 confirmed the involvement of this splicing factor in subtype-specific {AS}. The subtype-specific {AS} detected in this study likely reflects the splicing pattern in the breast cancer progenitor cells in which the tumor arose and suggests the utility of assays for Fox-mediated {AS} in cancer subtype definition and early detection. These data also suggest the possibility of reducing the toxicity of protein-targeted breast cancer treatments by targeting protein isoforms that are not present in limiting normal tissues.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: African-American ({AA}) and white patients with early-stage disease who were treated with breast conservation therapy ({BCT}) were examined to detect differences in clinicopathologic features and outcomes as a function of race. {METHODS}: Clinical data from the charts of 2164 white and 207 {AA} patients treated with {BCT}, and p53 expression status on 444 patients (from an existing tissue database), were analyzed to detect differences between the 2 cohorts. {RESULTS}: The median follow-up was 7 years. There were no differences in the method of tumor detection, lymph nodes excised, surgical margin status, or chemotherapy/radiotherapy delivered, reflecting similar screening and treatment policies for {AA} women in the study community. Despite this, {AA} patient presented at a younger age, with higher T and N classifications, and more estrogen and progesterone negative and "triple negative" tumors (all P values {\textless} .016). Tumors in {AA} patients were p53 positive more often than tumors in white patients (P= .0003). At 10 years, {AA} patients had a higher rate of distant metastasis (20\% vs 17\%; P= .042), lymph node recurrence (6\% vs 2\%; P= .004), and breast recurrence (17\% vs 13\%; P= .036). There was no difference in overall survival between the 2 groups. On multivariate analysis, only lymph node recurrence (risk ratio of 3.140; 95\% confidence interval, 1.396-7.063 [P= .0057]) remained significantly higher among {AA} women. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this cohort of uniformly treated patients, the authors found the expected clinicopathologic differences, but race was not found to be an independent predictor of local recurrence for {AA} patients when other confounding variables were taken into account in the multivariate model. These findings suggest that {BCT} is a reasonable option for appropriately selected {AA} patients. To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest study addressing outcomes after {BCT} for {AA} women published to date.},

This study explored women's knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about breast cancer to learn about risk perceptions. Six focus groups were conducted in North Carolina with 57 women (ages 18-49). Age, race (especially perceptions of cancer as a "White disease"), and lack of family history of breast cancer were all shown to contribute to women's perceptions of low breast cancer susceptibility. Perceptions of low risk were also attributed to conflicting risk information from family, media, and health providers. Women had little to no knowledge of breast cancer subtypes, and emphasized that health communications should be personally relevant, culturally appropriate, and convenient. These findings will assist in developing health communication tools that encourage prevention.},

However, it remains a mystery how aquaporin-2 (an integral membrane protein) and other apical transporters are delivered to the urine. Here we address the hypothesis that these proteins reach the urine through the secretion of exosomes [membrane vesicles that originate as internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies ({MVBs})]. Low-density urinary membrane vesicles from normal human subjects were isolated by differential centrifugation. {ImmunoGold} electron microscopy using antibodies directed to cytoplasmic or anticytoplasmic epitopes revealed that the vesicles are oriented "cytoplasmic-side inward," consistent with the unique orientation of exosomes. The vesicles were small ({\textless}100 nm), consistent with studies of {MVBs} and exosomes from other tissues. Proteomic analysis of urinary vesicles through nanospray liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified numerous protein components of {MVBs} and of the endosomal pathway in general. Full liquid chromatography-tandem {MS} analysis revealed 295 proteins, including multiple protein products of genes already known to be responsible for renal and systemic diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Gitelman syndrome, Bartter syndrome, autosomal recessive syndrome of osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis, and familial renal hypomagnesemia. The results indicate that exosome isolation may provide an efficient first step in biomarker discovery in urine.},

Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Relative risks associated with {IDC} or {ILC} and other important prognostic factors and adjusted for each other were computed using Cox proportional hazard regression. The proportion of grade I tumors was significantly higher in {ILC} (41\%) than in {IDC} (16\%). Conversely, the proportion of grade {III} tumors was only 18\% in {ILC} as against 41\% in {IDC} (p = 0.020). The 10-year survival of women with {IDC} was 69\%, compared to 84\% for {ILC} (p = 0.073). However, the 15 percentile point difference between overall survival of {IDC} and {ILC} was markedly reduced after adjustment for nodal status. The difference was eight percentile points for node-negative patients (p = 0.361) and five percentile points for node-positive patients (p = 0.464). Age at diagnosis, tumor size, pathologic stage, and lymph node status were independent prognostic indicators for 10-year survival. There was no prognostic difference between {IDC} and {ILC}. The result shows the importance of adjusting for other important clinicopathologic characteristics before comparing the overall survival of {IDC} and {ILC}.},

Reformulating this multilinear {HOSVD} such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this {HOSVD} with an integration of genome-scale {mRNA} expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression. A genome-scale correlation between {DNA} replication initiation and {RNA} transcription, which is equivalent to a recently discovered correlation and might be due to a previously unknown mechanism of regulation, is independently uncovered.},

We present an empirical study in which we compare some of the most commonly used feature selection methods. We apply these to 9 publicly available datasets, and compare, both the gene lists produced and how these perform in class prediction of test datasets. {RESULTS}: In this study, we compared the efficiency of the feature selection methods; significance analysis of microarrays ({SAM}), analysis of variance ({ANOVA}), empirical bayes t-statistic, template matching, {maxT}, between group analysis ({BGA}), Area under the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve, the Welch t-statistic, fold change, rank products, and sets of randomly selected genes. In each case these methods were applied to 9 different binary (two class) microarray datasets. Firstly we found little agreement in gene lists produced by the different methods. Only 8 to 21\% of genes were in common across all 10 feature selection methods. Secondly, we evaluated the class prediction efficiency of each gene list in training and test cross-validation using four supervised classifiers. {CONCLUSION}: We report that the choice of feature selection method, the number of genes in the genelist, the number of cases (samples) and the noise in the dataset, substantially influence classification success. Recommendations are made for choice of feature selection. Area under a {ROC} curve performed well with datasets that had low levels of noise and large sample size. Rank products performs well when datasets had low numbers of samples or high levels of noise. The Empirical bayes t-statistic performed well across a range of sample sizes.},

	abstract = {Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and its incidence has doubled in the last two decades. It represents only 4\% of skin cancer cases per year, but causes as many as 74\% of skin cancer deaths. Early detection of malignant melanoma is associated with survival rates of up to 90\%, but later detection (stage {III} to stage {IV}) is associated with survival rates of only 10\%. Dysregulation of {microRNA} ({miRNA}) expression has been linked to tumor development and progression by functioning either as a tumor suppressor, an oncogene or a metastasis regulator in multiple cancer types. To understand the role of {miRNA} in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma and identify biomarkers of metastasis, {miRNA} expression profiles in skin punches from 33 metastatic melanoma patients and 14 normal healthy donors were compared. We identified a cluster of 14 {miRNAs} on the X chromosome, termed the {miR}-506-514 cluster, which was consistently overexpressed in nearly all melanomas tested (30-60 fold, P{\textless}0.001), regardless of mutations in N-ras or B-raf. Inhibition of the expression of this cluster as a whole, or one of its sub-clusters (Sub-cluster A) consisting of six mature {miRNAs}, led to significant inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased invasiveness and decreased colony formation in soft agar across multiple melanoma cell lines. Sub-cluster A of the {miR}-506-514 cluster was critical for maintaining the cancer phenotype, but the overexpression of the full cluster was necessary for melanocyte transformation. Our results provide new insights into the functional role of this {miRNA} cluster in melanoma, and suggest new approaches to treat or diagnose this disease.},

Cancer genomes differ dramatically due to genetic and environmental factors. A major challenge in interpreting the large volume of mutation data identified in cancer genomes using next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) is to distinguish driver mutations from neutral passenger mutations. We propose a novel mutation network method, {VarWalker}, to prioritize driver genes in large scale cancer mutation data. Applying our approach in a large cohort of lung adenocarcinoma samples and melanoma samples, we derived a consensus mutation subnetwork for each cancer containing significantly enriched cancer genes and cancer-related functional pathways. Our results indicated that driver genes occur within a broad spectrum of frequency, interact with each other, and converge in several key pathways that play critical roles in tumorigenesis.},

Recent studies in mice have shown that inhibition of poly({ADP}-ribose) polymerase-1 ({PARP}-1) targets cells lacking Brca2 and xenografts derived from {BRCA}2-deficient {ES} cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells. We set out to develop a more relevant preclinical model that will inform and accelerate translation into the clinic. As such, we conditionally deleted Brca2 and p53 within murine mammary epithelium and treated the resulting tumors in situ with a highly potent {PARP}-1 inhibitor ({AZD}2281) alone or in combination with carboplatin. Daily exposure to {AZD}2281 for 28 days caused significant regression or growth inhibition in 46 of 52 tumors. This response was shown to be specific to tumors lacking both Brca2and p53. {AZD}2281/carboplatin combination therapy for 28 days showed no advantage over carboplatin monotherapy. However, if {PARP} inhibitor treatment was continued, this significantly increased the time to tumor relapse and death in these mice. This preclinical study is the first to show in vivo hypersensitivity of spontaneously arising Brca2-deficient mammary tumors to {PARP}-1 inhibition monotherapy or combination therapy. As such, our data add substantial weight to the argument for the use of {PARP} inhibitors as therapeutic agents against human breast cancers in which {BRCA}2 is mutated. Moreover, the specificity that we have shown further suggests that {PARP} inhibitors will be generally effective against tumors caused by dysregulation of components of the homologous recombination pathway.},

This review describes the role of {microRNAs} during the multiple steps that drive the progressive transformation of normal cells into highly malignant derivatives, outlining the role of {microRNAs} in regulating the common hallmarks of tumorigenesis: self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, abnormal apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, induction and sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion and metastasis. Recent evidence suggests an important role of {microRNAs} in the regulation of the expression of most genes regulating and coordinating a wide variety of processes in endocrine glands.

Through this overview of how {microRNAs} regulate multiple targets and entire pathways, we will provide insight into the potential to develop new molecular {microRNA}-targeted therapies for endocrine tumors.},

To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging ({CS}-{BLI}) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. {CS}-{BLI} is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, {NF}-{kappaB}, {HIF}-1alpha, myc, {hTERT} and {IRF}4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, {CS}-{BLI} can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of {CS}-{BLI}, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.},

Application of the method, termed expression deconvolution, to yeast grown under varying conditions reveals the population dynamics of the cells during the cell cycle, during the arrest of cells induced by {DNA} damage and the release of arrest in a cell cycle checkpoint mutant, during sporulation, and following environmental stress. Using expression deconvolution, cell cycle defects are detected and temporally ordered in 146 yeast deletion mutants; six of these defects are independently experimentally validated.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Ovarian cancer causes more than 15000 deaths per year in the United States. The survival of patients is quite heterogeneous, and accurate prognostic tools would help with the clinical management of these patients.
{METHODS}: We developed and validated two gene expression signatures, the first for predicting survival in advanced-stage, serous ovarian cancer and the second for predicting debulking status. We integrated 13 publicly available datasets totaling 1525 subjects. We trained prediction models using a meta-analysis variation on the compound covariable method, tested models by a "leave-one-dataset-out" procedure, and validated models in additional independent datasets. Selected genes from the debulking signature were validated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ({qRT}-{PCR}) in two further independent cohorts of 179 and 78 patients, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: The survival signature stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups (hazard ratio = 2.19; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.84 to 2.61) statistically significantly better than the {TCGA} signature (P = .04). {POSTN}, {CXCL}14, {FAP}, {NUAK}1, {PTCH}1, and {TGFBR}2 were validated by {qRT}-{PCR} (P {\textless} .05) and {POSTN}, {CXCL}14, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 were validated by immunohistochemistry (P {\textless} .001) as independent predictors of debulking status. The sum of immunohistochemistry intensities for these three proteins provided a tool that classified 92.8\% of samples correctly in high- and low-risk groups for suboptimal debulking (area under the curve = 0.89; 95\% {CI} = 0.84 to 0.93).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our survival signature provides the most accurate and validated prognostic model for early- and advanced-stage high-grade, serous ovarian cancer. The debulking signature accurately predicts the outcome of cytoreductive surgery, potentially allowing for stratification of patients for primary vs secondary cytoreduction.},

{METHODS}: We analysed gene expression in 73 {NlEpi} samples microdissected from frozen tissue. In 42 samples, we used microarrays to compare gene expression between 18 {RM} patients and 18 age-matched {HN} (9 oestrogen receptor ({ER})+, 9 {ER}-) and 6 {PM} patients. Data were analysed using a Bayesian approach ({BADGE}), and validated with quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}) in 31 independent {NlEpi} samples from 8 {RM}, 17 {HN}, and 6 {PM} patients.
{RESULTS}: A total of 98 probe sets (86 genes) were differentially expressed between {RM} and {HN} samples. Performing hierarchical analysis with these 98 probe sets, {PM} and {HN} samples clustered together, away from {RM} samples. {qPCR} validation of independent samples was high (84\%) and uniform in {RM} compared with {HN} patients, and lower (58\%), but more heterogeneous, in {RM} compared with {PM} patients. The 86 genes were implicated in many processes including transcription and the {MAPK} pathway.
{CONCLUSION}: Gene expression differs between the {NlEpi} of breast cancer cases and controls. The profile of cancer cases can be discerned in high-risk {NlEpi} from cancer-free breasts. This suggests that the profile is not an effect of the tumour, but may mark increased risk and reveal the earliest genomic changes of breast cancer.},

However, for many cancer subtypes, including triple‐negative breast cancer ({TNBC}), no frequently recurring aberrations could be identified to make such an approach clinically feasible. Characterized by a highly heterogeneous mutational landscape with few common features, many {TNBCs} cluster together based on their ‘basal‐like’ transcriptional profiles. We therefore hypothesized that targeting {TNBC} cells on a systems level by exploiting the transcriptional cell state might be a viable strategy to find novel therapies for this highly aggressive disease. We performed a large‐scale chemical genetic screen and identified a group of compounds related to the drug {PKC}412 (midostaurin). {PKC}412 induced apoptosis in a subset of {TNBC} cells enriched for the basal‐like subtype and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. We employed a multi‐omics approach and computational modeling to address the mechanism of action and identified spleen tyrosine kinase ({SYK}) as a novel and unexpected target in {TNBC}. Quantitative phosphoproteomics revealed that {SYK} inhibition abrogates signaling to {STAT}3, explaining the selectivity for basal‐like breast cancer cells. This non‐oncogene addiction suggests that chemical {SYK} inhibition may be beneficial for a specific subset of {TNBC} patients and demonstrates that targeting cell states could be a viable strategy to discover novel treatment strategies.
Synopsis



A chemical screen and systems approach reveal {SYK}‐{STAT}3 signaling as a druggable target in basal‐like breast cancers. The study supports the systems‐based notion that targeting a cell state, rather than a mutational state, can lead to therapeutic target discovery.

A chemical screen identifies a set of structurally related small molecules, including the drug midostaurin ({PKC}412), that target the mesenchymal cell state found in a subset of breast tumors.A multi‐omics approach is combined with computational modeling for examining the drug mechanism of action and reveals the tyrosine kinase {SYK} as a novel breast cancer target.Phospho‐proteomics analysis shows that {SYK} is required to maintain {STAT}3 phosphorylation in basal‐like breast cancer cells.},

The {PI}(3)K/{AKT} pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread {DNA} hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase {SETD}2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the {SWI}/{SNF} chromatin remodelling complex ({PBRM}1, {ARID}1A, {SMARCA}4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the {TCA} cycle, decreased {AMPK} and {PTEN} protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of {miR}-21 (also known as {MIR}21) and {GRB}10.

	abstract = {Background Data integration is currently one of the main challenges in the biomedical sciences. Often different pieces of information are gathered on the same set of entities (e.g., tissues, culture samples, biomolecules) with the different pieces stemming, for example, from different measurement techniques. This implies that more and more data appear that consist of two or more data arrays that have a shared mode. An integrative analysis of such coupled data should be based on a simultaneous analysis of all data arrays. In this respect, the family of simultaneous component methods (e.g., {SUM}-{PCA}, unrestricted {PCovR}, {MFA}, {STATIS}, and {SCA}-P) is a natural choice. Yet, different simultaneous component methods may lead to quite different results. Results We offer a structured overview of simultaneous component methods that frames them in a principal components setting such that both the common core of the methods and the specific elements with regard to which they differ are highlighted. An overview of principles is given that may guide the data analyst in choosing an appropriate simultaneous component method. Several theoretical and practical issues are illustrated with an empirical example on metabolomics data for Escherichia coli as obtained with different analytical chemical measurement methods. Conclusion Of the aspects in which the simultaneous component methods differ, pre-processing and weighting are consequential. Especially, the type of weighting of the different matrices is essential for simultaneous component analysis. These types are shown to be linked to different specifications of the idea of a fair integration of the different coupled arrays.},

High expression of {ATM} and cyclin B1 was related to well-differentiated endocrine tumors of the World Health Organization ({WHO}) classification, but not related to {TNM} stages. The high {ATM} expression group ({ATM} ≥ 4) had a significantly smaller tumor size, lower recurrence rate, more number of functioning tumor, and well differentiation of {WHO} classification. The high cyclin B1 expression group (cyclin B1 ≥5) was related to smaller tumor size, less vascular invasion, less recurrence rate, and less death rate. However, cyclin B1 was the only significant factor for survival following multivariate analysis (p = 0.008; {OR}, 0.54; 95 \% {CI}, 0.35-0.85). The current results suggested that expression of {ATM} and cyclin B1 may be useful markers to identify patients with poor prognosis who may benefit from close follow-up and aggressive therapy in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Most tumor tissue is composed of parenchymal tumor cells and tumor stroma. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) can function as precursors for tumor stromal cells, including myofibroblasts, which provide a favorable environment for tumor progression. A close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a tumor microenvironment has been described. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are enriched with a discrete set of cellular proteins, and are therefore expected to exert diverse biological functions according to cell origin.
{METHODS}: In the current study, we determined the biological effect of exosomes from two ovarian cancer cell lines ({SK}-{OV}-3 and {OVCAR}-3) on adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}).
{RESULTS}: Exosome treatment induced {ADSCs} to exhibit the typical characteristics of tumor-associated myofibroblasts, with increased expression of α-{SMA}, and also increased expression of tumor-promoting factors ({SDF}-1 and {TGF}-β). This phenomenon was correlated with an increased expression of {TGF}-β receptors I and {II}. Analysis of {TGF}-β receptor-mediated downstream signaling pathways revealed that each exosome activated different signaling pathways, showing that exosomes from {SK}-{OV}-3 cells increased the phosphorylated form of {SMAD}2, which is essential in the {SMAD}-dependent pathway, whereas exosomes from {OVCAR}-3 cells increased the phosphorylated form of {AKT}, a representative {SMAD}-independent pathway. Taken together, exosomes from ovarian cancer cells induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} by activating an intracellular signaling pathway, although the activated pathway could differ from exosome-to-exosome.
{CONCLUSION}: The current study suggested that ovarian cancer-derived exosomes contribute to the generation of tumor-associated myofibroblasts from {MSCs} in tumor stroma.},

Although large-scale gene expression analysis undoubtly have raised interesting new hypothesis concerning genes thought to play a role in tumor biology, discrepancies observed between studies and various platforms used, emphasizes the need to not only standardize the way microarray data are reported, but also to introduce standards in sample taking, processing and study design. In addition, the recognition of the complexity of the human proteome, with regard to generation of multiple isoforms from one gene, has created additional challenges.

	abstract = {Exosomes are bioactive vesicles derived from the cell's endosomal membrane system and secreted into surrounding body fluids. Exosomes contain cell and cell-state specific cargos of protein, {mRNA} and {miRNA}. Exosome formation, cargo content, and delivery to surrounding cells is of immense biological interest considering the role that exosomes are believed to play in various pathological conditions. They aid antigen presentation by immune cells and can exhibit either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory properties depending on the parent antigen-presenting cell's conditioning. Viruses can hijack a host cell's exosomal machinery to evade host defense systems aiding in the trans-infection of viruses. Tumor derived exosomes may help establish an oncogenic niche systemically via delivery of protein, {mRNA}, and {miRNA} that can aid angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Exosomes have also been implicated in the spread of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have shown that exosomes are selectively taken up by cells distal from their release. They can reprogram the recipient cells due to their active molecular cargo. Cell-lineage and state-specific exosomes imply that they may therefore harbor body fluid-based biomarkers of unparalleled accuracy, particularly for tissues that are difficult or impossible to access. Exosome-specific membrane proteins provide markers enabling exosome identity and selection, while cell type and cell condition-specific protein, {mRNA} and {miRNA} cargo provide a rich potential source of biomarkers. This review serves to provide an overview of the current state of the science in the burgeoning field of exosome biology.},

Immunohistochemical markers were used to subtype 1,424 cases of invasive and in situ breast cancer, and case subtypes were compared to 2,022 controls. Luminal A, the most common subtype, exhibited risk factors typically reported for breast cancer in previous studies, including inverse associations for increased parity and younger age at first full-term pregnancy. Basal-like cases exhibited several associations that were opposite to those observed for luminal A, including increased risk for parity and younger age at first term full-term pregnancy. Longer duration breastfeeding, increasing number of children breastfed, and increasing number of months breastfeeding per child were each associated with reduced risk of basal-like breast cancer, but not luminal A. Women with multiple live births who did not breastfeed and women who used medications to suppress lactation were at increased risk of basal-like, but not luminal A, breast cancer. Elevated waist-hip ratio was associated with increased risk of luminal A in postmenopausal women, and increased risk of basal-like breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. The prevalence of basal-like breast cancer was highest among premenopausal African-American women, who also showed the highest prevalence of basal-like risk factors. Among younger African-American women, we estimate that up to 68\% of basal-like breast cancer could be prevented by promoting breastfeeding and reducing abdominal adiposity.},

Compared with current methods, this integrated system has a much higher detection sensitivity, and can differentiate glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}) {MVs} from non-tumor host cell-derived {MVs}. We also show that circulating {GBM} {MVs} can serve as a surrogate for primary tumor mutations and a predictive metric of treatment-induced changes.

While the technology to produce multi-dimensional datasets is readily available, the means for facile analysis of such data are limited. The objective of this study was to develop a systems approach to infer regulatory mechanisms governing global gene expression in cytokine-challenged cells in vitro, and to apply these methods to predict gene regulatory networks ({GRNs}) in intrauterine tissues during term parturition. To this end, microarray analysis was applied to human amnion mesenchymal cells ({AMCs}) stimulated with interleukin-1β, and differentially expressed transcripts were subjected to hierarchical clustering, temporal expression profiling, and motif enrichment analysis, from which a {GRN} was constructed. These methods were then applied to fetal membrane specimens collected in the absence or presence of spontaneous term labor. Analysis of cytokine-responsive genes in {AMCs} revealed a sterile immune response signature, with promoters enriched in response elements for several inflammation-associated transcription factors. In comparison to the fetal membrane dataset, there were 34 genes commonly upregulated, many of which were part of an acute inflammation gene expression signature. Binding motifs for nuclear factor-κB were prominent in the gene interaction and regulatory networks for both datasets; however, we found little evidence to support the utilization of pathogen-associated molecular pattern ({PAMP}) signaling. The tissue specimens were also enriched for transcripts governed by hypoxia-inducible factor. The approach presented here provides an uncomplicated means to infer global relationships among gene clusters involved in cellular responses to labor-associated signals.},

Microvesicles ({MVs}) are fragments of the plasma membrane secreted from cytoplasmic membrane compartments by normal and malignant cells.

We hypothesized that {MV} number and the relative amount of focal adhesion kinase ({FAK}) and epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) proteins in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} are related to the presence of breast cancer.
{METHODS}: Plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} were obtained by differential centrifugation of blood samples. {MV} number was evaluated by {BD} {TruCOUNT} Tubes ({BD} Biosciences). {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins were analyzed by Western blot.
{RESULTS}: {MV} number in plasma fractions enriched with {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} is higher in breast cancer patients with stages I-{IV} as well as with T2-T4 tumors, in comparison to control group.

These tumors are enriched in gene expression signatures derived from human tumor-initiating cells ({TICs}) and human mammary stem cells. Through cross-species analysis, we discovered mouse mammary tumors that have similar gene expression characteristics as human claudin-low tumors and were also enriched for the human {TIC} signature. Such claudin-low tumors were similarly rare but came from a number of distinct mouse models, including the p53 null transplant model. Here we present a molecular characterization of 50 p53 null mammary tumors compared with other mouse models and human breast tumor subtypes. Similar to human tumors, the murine p53 null tumors fell into multiple molecular subtypes, including two basal-like, a luminal, a claudin-low, and a subtype unique to this model. The claudin-low tumors also showed high gene expression of {EMT} inducers, low expression of the {miR}-200 family, and low to absent expression of both claudin 3 and E-cadherin. These murine subtypes also contained distinct genomic {DNA} copy number changes, some of which are similarly altered in their cognate human subtype counterpart. Finally, limiting dilution transplantation revealed that p53 null claudin-low tumors are highly enriched for {TICs} compared with the more common adenocarcinomas arising in the same model, thus providing a unique preclinical mouse model to investigate the therapeutic response of {TICs}.},

{METHODS}: We studied 2208 parents and siblings of 504 unselected population-based Caucasian women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 35 years (103 from {USA}, 124 from Canada and 277 from Australia), 41 known to carry a mutation (24 in {BRCA}1, 16 in {BRCA}2 and one in both genes). Cancer-specific standardised incidence ratios ({SIRs}) were estimated by comparing the number of affected relatives (50\% verified overall) with that expected based on incidences specific for country, sex, age and year of birth.
{RESULTS}: For relatives of carriers, the female breast cancer {SIRs} were 13.13 (95\% {CI} 6.57-26.26) and 12.52 (5.21-30.07) for {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2, respectively. The ovarian cancer {SIR} was 12.38 (3.1-49.51) for {BRCA}1 and the prostate cancer {SIR} was 18.55 (4.64-74.17) for {BRCA}2. For relatives of non-carriers, the {SIRs} for female breast, prostate, lung, brain and urinary cancers were 4.03 (2.91-5.93), 5.25 (2.50-11.01), 7.73 (4.74-12.62), 5.19 (2.33-11.54) and 4.35 (1.81-10.46), respectively. For non-carriers, the {SIRs} remained elevated and were statistically significant for breast and prostate cancer when based on verified cancers.
{CONCLUSION}: First-degree relatives of women with very early-onset breast cancer are at increased risk of cancers not explained by {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 mutations.},

{DESIGN}: Independent evaluation of six genomic tests [Oncotype Dx™, {MammaPrint}(®), Genomic Grade Index, {PAM}50 ({ROR}-S), Breast Cancer Index, and {EndoPredict}] was carried out by a panel of experts in three parameters: analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility based on the principles of the {EGAPP} criteria. {PANEL} {STATEMENTS}: The majority of the working group members found the available evidence on the analytical and clinical validity of Oncotype Dx™ and {MammaPrint}(®) to be convincing. None of the genomic tests demonstrated robust evidence of clinical utility: it was not clear from the current evidence that modifying treatment decisions based on the results of a given genomic test could result in improving clinical outcome.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {IMPAKT} 2012 Working Group proposed the following recommendations: (i) a need to develop models that integrate clinicopathologic factors along with genomic tests; (ii) demonstration of clinical utility should be made in the context of a prospective randomized trial; and (iii) the creation of registries for patients who are subjected to genomic testing in the daily practice.},

	abstract = {The tumor suppressors p53, p73, and p63 are known to function as transcription factors. They promote either growth arrest or apoptosis, depending upon the {DNA} damage. A number of {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) have been shown to function as transcriptional targets of p53 and they appear to aid p53 in promoting growth arrest and apoptosis. However, the question of p53/p63/p73 regulating the {miRNA} processing complex has not been addressed in depth so far. Comparative/computational genomic analysis was performed using Target scan, Mami, and Diana software to identify {miRNAs} that regulate the {miRNA} processing complex. Here, I present evidence for the first time that the tumor suppressors p53, p63, and p73 function as both positive and negative regulators of the {miRNA} processing components. Curated p53-dependent {miRNA} expression data was used to identify p53-{miRs} that target the components of the {miRNA}-processing complex. This analysis suggests that most of the components ({mRNAs}' 3'{UTR}) of the {miRNA} processing complex are targeted by p53-{miRs}. Remarkably, this data revealed the conserved nature of p53-{miRs} in targeting a number of components of the {miRNA} processing complex. p53/p73/p63 appears to regulate the major components of the {miRNA} processing, such as Drosha-{DGCR}8, Dicer-{TRBP}2, and Argonaute proteins. In particular, p53/p73/p63 appears to regulate the processing of {miRNAs}, such as let-7, {miR}-200c, {miR}-143, {miR}-107, {miR}-16, {miR}-145, {miR}-134, {miR}-449a, {miR}-503, and {miR}-21. Interestingly, there seems to be a phenotypic similarity between p63(-/-) and dicer(-/-) mice, suggesting that p63 and dicer could regulate each other. In addition, p63, p73, and the {DGCR}8 proteins contain a conserved interaction domain. Further, promoters of a number of components of the {miRNA} processing machinery, including dicer and P2P-R, contain p53-{REs}, suggesting that they could be direct transcriptional targets of p63/p73/p53. Together, this study provides mechanistic insights into how p53, p63, and p73 regulate the components of the {miRNA} processing; and how p53, {TA}-p63, and {TA}-p73 regulated {miRNAs} inhibit tumorigenesis, {EMT}, metastasis, and cancer stem cell proliferation.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are nanovesicles that have emerged as a new intercellular communication system between an intracellular compartment of a donor cell towards the periphery or an internal compartment of a recipient cell. The bioactivity of exosomes resides not only in their protein and {RNA} contents but also in their lipidic molecules. Exosomes display original lipids organized in a bilayer membrane and along with the lipid carriers such as fatty acid binding proteins that they contain, exosomes transport bioactive lipids. Exosomes can vectorize lipids such as eicosanoids, fatty acids, and cholesterol, and their lipid composition can be modified by in-vitro manipulation. They also contain lipid related enzymes so that they can constitute an autonomous unit of production of various bioactive lipids. Exosomes can circulate between proximal or distal cells and their fate can be regulated in part by lipidic molecules. Compared to their parental cells, exosomes are enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin and their accumulation in cells might modulate recipient cell homeostasis. Exosome release from cells appears to be a general biological process. They have been reported in all biological fluids from which they can be recovered and can be monitors of specific pathophysiological situations. Thus, the lipid content of circulating exosomes could be useful biomarkers of lipid related diseases. Since the first lipid analysis of exosomes ten years ago detailed knowledge of exosomal lipids has accumulated. The role of lipids in exosome fate and bioactivity and how they constitute an additional lipid transport system are considered in this review.},

Such data provide unique opportunities to study the coordination between regulatory mechanisms on multiple levels. However, integrative analysis of multi-dimensional genomics data for the discovery of combinatorial patterns is currently lacking. Here, we adopt a joint matrix factorization technique to address this challenge. This method projects multiple types of genomic data onto a common coordinate system, in which heterogeneous variables weighted highly in the same projected direction form a multi-dimensional module (md-module). Genomic variables in such modules are characterized by significant correlations and likely functional associations. We applied this method to the {DM}, {GE}, and {microRNA} expression data of 385 ovarian cancer samples from the The Cancer Genome Atlas project. These md-modules revealed perturbed pathways that would have been overlooked with only a single type of data, uncovered associations between different layers of cellular activities and allowed the identification of clinically distinct patient subgroups. Our study provides an useful protocol for uncovering hidden patterns and their biological implications in multi-dimensional 'omic' data.},

	abstract = {A major goal in translational cancer research is to identify biological signatures driving cancer progression and metastasis. A common technique applied in genomics research is to cluster patients using gene expression data from a candidate prognostic gene set, and if the resulting clusters show statistically significant outcome stratification, to associate the gene set with prognosis, suggesting its biological and clinical importance. Recent work has questioned the validity of this approach by showing in several breast cancer data sets that "random" gene sets tend to cluster patients into prognostically variable subgroups. This work suggests that new rigorous statistical methods are needed to identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets. To address this problem, we developed Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures ({SAPS}) which integrates standard prognostic tests with a new prognostic significance test based on stratifying patients into prognostic subtypes with random gene sets. {SAPS} ensures that a significant gene set is not only able to stratify patients into prognostically variable groups, but is also enriched for genes showing strong univariate associations with patient prognosis, and performs significantly better than random gene sets. We use {SAPS} to perform a large meta-analysis (the largest completed to date) of prognostic pathways in breast and ovarian cancer and their molecular subtypes. Our analyses show that only a small subset of the gene sets found statistically significant using standard measures achieve significance by {SAPS}. We identify new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer and their corresponding molecular subtypes, and we show that prognostic signatures in {ER} negative breast cancer are more similar to prognostic signatures in ovarian cancer than to prognostic signatures in {ER} positive breast cancer. {SAPS} is a powerful new method for deriving robust prognostic biological signatures from clinically annotated genomic datasets.},

	abstract = {Ghrelin as a human natural hormone is involved in fundamental regulatory processes of eating and energy balance. Ghrelin signals the nutrient availability from the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system, up-regulates food intake and lowers energy expenditure mainly through hypothalamic mediators acting both centrally and peripheral including the gastrointestinal tract (motility, epithelium), promotes both neuro-endocrine and inflammatory signals to increase skeletal muscle growth and decrease protein breakdown, and increases lipolysis while body fat utilization is reduced. Ghrelin does more to exert its probably sentinel role around "human energy:" it influences through mainly extra-hypothalamic actions the hedonic and incentive value of food, mood and anxiety, sleep-wake regulation, learning and memory, and neurogenesis. Recently numerous ghrelin gene-derived peptides were discovered, demonstrating the complexity within the ghrelin/ghrelin receptor axis. For clinical applications, not only the natural ghrelin and its slice variants, but also several modified or artificial molecules acting at ghrelin-associated receptors were and are developed. Current clinical applications are limited to clinical studies, focusing mainly on cachexia in chronic heart failure, {COPD}, cancer, end-stage-renal-disease or cystic fibrosis, but also on frailty in elderly, gastrointestinal motility (e.g., gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, postoperative ileus), after curative gastrectomy, anorexia nervosa, growth hormone deficient patients, alcohol craving, sleep-wake regulation (e.g. major depression), or sympathetic nervous activity in obesity. The results of completed, preliminary studies support the clinical potential of ghrelin, ghrelin gene-derived peptides, and artificial analogues, suggesting that larger clinical trials are demanded to move ghrelin towards an available and reimbursed pharmaceutical intervention.},

Since many cell types associated with the mammary gland express {PPARγ}, each with unique signal patterns, this study aimed to define which tissues are required for {PPARγ}-dependent antitumour effects. Accordingly, adipocyte-specific {PPARγ} knockout ({PPARγ}-A {KO}) mice and their wild-type ({PPARγ}-{WT}) controls were generated, and treated with {DMBA} for 6 weeks to initiate breast tumorigenesis. On week 7, mice were randomized to continue on normal chow diet or one supplemented with rosiglitazone ({ROSI}), and followed for 25 weeks for tumour outcomes. In {PPARγ}-A {KO} versus {PPARγ}-{WT} mice, malignant mammary tumour incidence was significantly higher and mammary tumour latency was decreased. {DMBA} + {ROSI} treatment reduced average mammary tumour volumes by 50\%. Gene expression analyses of mammary glands by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence indicated that untreated {PPARγ}-A {KOs} had significantly decreased {BRCA}1 expression in mammary stromal adipocytes. Compared with {PPARγ}-{WT} mice, serum leptin levels in {PPARγ}-A {KOs} were also significantly higher throughout the study. Together, these data are the first to suggest that in vivo {PPARγ} expression in mammary stromal adipocytes attenuates breast tumorigenesis through {BRCA}1 upregulation and decreased leptin secretion.

Other than altered expression of E-cadherin, little is known about the underlying biology that distinguishes the tumor subtypes. We used {cDNA} microarrays to identify genes differentially expressed between lobular and ductal tumors. Unsupervised clustering of tumors failed to distinguish between the two subtypes. Prediction analysis for microarrays ({PAM}) was able to predict tumor type with an accuracy of 93.7\%. Genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups were identified by {MaxT} permutation analysis using t tests (20 {cDNA} clones and 10 unique genes), significance analysis for microarrays (33 {cDNA} clones and 15 genes, at an estimated false discovery rate of 2\%), and {PAM} (31 {cDNAs} and 15 genes). There were 8 genes identified by all three of these related methods (E-cadherin, survivin, cathepsin B, {TPI}1, {SPRY}1, {SCYA}14, {TFAP}2B, and thrombospondin 4), and an additional 3 that were identified by significance analysis for microarrays and {PAM} (osteopontin, {HLA}-G, and {CHC}1). To validate the differential expression of these genes, 7 of them were tested by real-time quantitative {PCR}, which verified that they were differentially expressed in lobular versus ductal tumors. In conclusion, specific changes in gene expression distinguish lobular from ductal breast carcinomas. These genes may be important in understanding the basis of phenotypic differences among breast cancers.},

It regulates protein secretion, for example translationally controlled tumor protein ({TCTP}), which is implicated in tumor reversion. In keeping with the latter, we show herein that {TSAP}6 is a glycosylated protein present in the trans-Golgi network, endosomal–vesicular compartment and cytoplasmic membrane. To further investigate the physiological function of {TSAP}6, we have generated {TSAP}6-deficient mice. These mice exhibit microcytic anemia with abnormal reticulocyte maturation and deficient transferrin receptor downregulation, a process known to be dependent on exosomal secretion. Moreover, we provide direct evidence that exosome production is severely compromised in {TSAP}6-null cells. Finally, we show that the {DNA} damage-induced p53-dependent nonclassical exosomal secretory pathway is abrogated in {TSAP}6-null cells. Given the fact that exosomes are used as cell-free vaccines against cancer and that they could be involved in the biogenesis and spread of human immunodeficiency virus, it is important to understand their regulation. The results presented here provide the first genetic demonstration that exosome formation is a tightly controlled biological process dependent of {TSAP}6.},

Recently, Landemaine and colleagues described a six-gene signature purported to predict lung metastasis risk. They analyzed gene expression in 23 metastases from breast cancer patients (5 lung, 18 non-lung) identifying a 21-gene signature. Expression of 16 of these was analyzed in primary breast tumors from 72 patients with known outcome, and six were selected that were predictive of lung metastases: {DSC}2, {TFCP}2L1, {UGT}8, {ITGB}8, {ANP}32E, and {FERMT}1. Despite the value of such a signature, our analysis indicates that this analysis ignored potentially important confounding factors and that their signature is instead a surrogate for molecular subtype.},

Meta-analysis using functionally or biologically characterized gene sets simplifies data integration is biologically intuitive and is seen as having great potential, but is an emerging field with few established statistical methods.
{RESULTS}: We transform gene expression profiles into binary gene set profiles by discretizing results of gene set enrichment analyses and apply a new iterative bi-clustering algorithm ({iBBiG}) to identify groups of gene sets that are coordinately associated with groups of phenotypes across multiple studies. {iBBiG} is optimized for meta-analysis of large numbers of diverse genomics data that may have unmatched samples. It does not require prior knowledge of the number or size of clusters. When applied to simulated data, it outperforms commonly used clustering methods, discovers overlapping clusters of diverse sizes and is robust in the presence of noise. We apply it to meta-analysis of breast cancer studies, where {iBBiG} extracted novel gene set-phenotype association that predicted tumor metastases within tumor subtypes.

	doi = {10.1186/1759-8753-3-15},
	abstract = {Background
Transposable elements ({TEs}) encode sequences necessary for their own transposition, including signals required for the termination of transcription. {TE} sequences within the introns of human genes show an antisense orientation bias, which has been proposed to reflect selection against {TE} sequences in the sense orientation owing to their ability to terminate the transcription of host gene transcripts. While there is evidence in support of this model for some elements, the extent to which {TE} sequences actually terminate transcription of human gene across the genome remains an open question.

Results
Using high-throughput sequencing data, we have characterized over 9,000 distinct {TE}-derived sequences that provide transcription termination sites for 5,747 human genes across eight different cell types. Rarefaction curve analysis suggests that there may be twice as many {TE}-derived termination sites ({TE}-{TTS}) genome-wide among all human cell types. The local chromatin environment for these {TE}-{TTS} is similar to that seen for 3′ {UTR} canonical {TTS} and distinct from the chromatin environment of other intragenic {TE} sequences. However, those {TE}-{TTS} located within the introns of human genes were found to be far more cell type-specific than the canonical {TTS}. {TE}-{TTS} were much more likely to be found in the sense orientation than other intragenic {TE} sequences of the same {TE} family and {TE}-{TTS} in the sense orientation terminate transcription more efficiently than those found in the antisense orientation. Alu sequences were found to provide a large number of relatively weak {TTS}, whereas {LTR} elements provided a smaller number of much stronger {TTS}.

Conclusions
{TE} sequences provide numerous termination sites to human genes, and {TE}-derived {TTS} are particularly cell type-specific. Thus, {TE} sequences provide a powerful mechanism for the diversification of transcriptional profiles between cell types and among evolutionary lineages, since most {TE}-{TTS} are evolutionarily young. The extent of transcription termination by {TEs} seen here, along with the preference for sense-oriented {TE} insertions to provide {TTS}, is consistent with the observed antisense orientation bias of human {TEs}.},

The relationships between brain regions associated with {PCI} and neuropsychological performance, self-reported cognition, and oxidative and direct {DNA} damage as measured in peripheral lymphocytes were assessed in secondary analyses. {PCI} was positively associated with {GMD} and activation on {fMRI} in the right anterior frontal region (Brodmann Areas 9 and 10) independent of participant age. {GMD} in this region was also positively correlated with global neuropsychological function.

	abstract = {Massively parallel {DNA} sequencing technologies have greatly increased our ability to generate large amounts of sequencing data at a rapid pace. Several methods have been developed to enrich for genomic regions of interest for targeted sequencing. We have compared three of these methods: Molecular Inversion Probes ({MIP}), Solution Hybrid Selection ({SHS}), and Microarray-based Genomic Selection ({MGS}). Using {HapMap} {DNA} samples, we compared each of these methods with respect to their ability to capture an identical set of exons and evolutionarily conserved regions associated with 528 genes (2.61 Mb). For sequence analysis, we developed and used a novel Bayesian genotype-assigning algorithm, Most Probable Genotype ({MPG}). All three capture methods were effective, but sensitivities (percentage of targeted bases associated with high-quality genotypes) varied for an equivalent amount of pass-filtered sequence: for example, 70\% ({MIP}), 84\% ({SHS}), and 91\% ({MGS}) for 400 Mb. In contrast, all methods yielded similar accuracies of {\textgreater}99.84\% when compared to Infinium 1M {SNP} {BeadChip}-derived genotypes and {\textgreater}99.998\% when compared to 30-fold coverage whole-genome shotgun sequencing data. We also observed a low false-positive rate with all three methods; of the heterozygous positions identified by each of the capture methods, {\textgreater}99.57\% agreed with 1M {SNP} {BeadChip}, and {\textgreater}98.840\% agreed with the whole-genome shotgun data. In addition, we successfully piloted the genomic enrichment of a set of 12 pooled samples via the {MGS} method using molecular bar codes. We find that these three genomic enrichment methods are highly accurate and practical, with sensitivities comparable to that of 30-fold coverage whole-genome shotgun data.},

While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that, given certain conditions, any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and reveal how stochasticity in single-cell behaviors promotes phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells.},

Over the last few years, however, a considerable amount of experimental evidence has demonstrated the occurrence of a sophisticated method of cell communication based on the release of specialized membranous nano-sized vesicles termed exosomes. Exosome biogenesis involves the endosomal compartment, the multivesicular bodies ({MVB}), which contain internal vesicles packed with an extraordinary set of molecules including enzymes, cytokines, nucleic acids and different bioactive compounds. In response to stimuli, {MVB} fuse with the plasma membrane and vesicles are released in the extracellular space where they can interact with neighboring cells and directly induce a signaling pathway or affect the cellular phenotype through the transfer of new receptors or even genetic material.

We propose that {BCa} risk resides in a subgroup of {SNPs} that functionally affects breast biology. Such a shortlist will aid in framing hypotheses to prioritize a manageable number of likely disease-causing {SNPs}. We extracted all the {SNPs}, residing in 1 Mb windows around breast cancer risk index {SNP} from the 1000 genomes project to find correlated {SNPs}. We used {FunciSNP}, an R/Bioconductor package developed in-house, to identify potentially functional {SNPs} at 71 risk loci by coinciding them with chromatin biofeatures. We identified 1,005 {SNPs} in {LD} with the index {SNPs} (r2≥0.5) in three categories; 21 in exons of 18 genes, 76 in transcription start site ({TSS}) regions of 25 genes, and 921 in enhancers. Thirteen {SNPs} were found in more than one category. We found two correlated and predicted non-benign coding variants (rs8100241 in exon 2 and rs8108174 in exon 3) of the gene, {ANKLE}1. Most putative functional {LD} {SNPs}, however, were found in either epigenetically defined enhancers or in gene {TSS} regions. Fifty-five percent of these non-coding {SNPs} are likely functional, since they affect response element ({RE}) sequences of transcription factors. Functionality of these {SNPs} was assessed by expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) analysis and allele-specific enhancer assays. Unbiased analyses of {SNPs} at {BCa} risk loci revealed new and overlooked mechanisms that may affect risk of the disease, thereby providing a valuable resource for follow-up studies.},

It is often convenient to have a single simple number characterizing the relationship between pairs of such high-dimensional datasets in a comprehensive way. Matrix correlations are such numbers and are appealing since they can be interpreted in the same way as Pearson's correlations familiar to biologists. The high-dimensionality of functional genomics data is, however, problematic for existing matrix correlations. The motivation of this article is 2-fold: (i) we introduce the idea of matrix correlations to the bioinformatics community and (ii) we give an improvement of the most promising matrix correlation coefficient (the {RV}-coefficient) circumventing the problems of high-dimensional data.
{RESULTS}: The modified {RV}-coefficient can be used in high-dimensional data analysis studies as an easy measure of common information of two datasets. This is shown by theoretical arguments, simulations and applications to two real-life examples from functional genomics, i.e. a transcriptomics and metabolomics example.

{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: A breast cancer tissue microarray containing 102 tumors was stained with an anti-survivin antibody. Whole-slide scanning was used to capture high-resolution images. These images were analyzed using automated algorithms to quantify the staining.
{RESULTS}: Increased nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, survivin was associated with a reduced overall survival ({OS}; P = 0.038) and disease-specific survival (P = 0.0015). A high cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio ({CNR}) of survivin was associated with improved {OS} (P = 0.005) and disease-specific survival (P = 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the survivin {CNR} was an independent predictor of {OS} (hazard ratio, 0.09; 95\% confidence interval, 0.01-0.76; P = 0.027). A survivin {CNR} of {\textgreater}5 correlated positively with estrogen receptor (P = 0.019) and progesterone receptor (P = 0.033) levels, whereas it was negatively associated with Ki-67 expression (P = 0.04), p53 status (P = 0.005), and c-myc amplification (P = 0.016).
{CONCLUSION}: Different prognostic information is supplied by nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin in breast cancer. Nuclear survivin is a poor prognostic marker in breast cancer. Moreover, {CNR} of survivin, as determined by image analysis, is an independent prognostic factor.},

Furthermore, metastatic cell variants have been shown to preexist in murine neoplasms of old and recent origin. The possible existence of highly metastatic variant cells within a primary tumor suggests that we no longer should consider a neoplasm to be a uniform entity. Efforts to design effective therapeutic agents and procedures against malignant tumors should be directed toward the few but fatal metastatic subpopulations of cells.},

	abstract = {Breast tumors consist of several different tissue components. Despite the heterogeneity, most gene expression analyses have traditionally been performed without prior microdissection of the tissue sample. Thus, the gene expression profiles obtained reflect the {mRNA} contribution from the various tissue components. We utilized histopathological estimations of area fractions of tumor and stromal tissue components in 198 fresh-frozen breast tumor tissue samples for a cell type-associated gene expression analysis associated with distant metastasis. Sets of differentially expressed gene-probes were identified in tumors from patients who developed distant metastasis compared with those who did not, by weighing the contribution from each tumor with the relative content of stromal and tumor epithelial cells in their individual tumor specimen. The analyses were performed under various assumptions of {mRNA} transcription level from tumor epithelial cells compared with stromal cells. A set of 30 differentially expressed gene-probes was ascribed solely to carcinoma cells. Furthermore, two sets of 38 and five differentially expressed gene-probes were mostly associated to tumor epithelial and stromal cells, respectively. Finally, a set of 26 differentially expressed gene-probes was identified independently of cell type focus. The differentially expressed genes were validated in independent gene expression data from a set of laser capture microdissected invasive ductal carcinomas. We present a method for identifying and ascribing differentially expressed genes to tumor epithelial and/or stromal cells, by utilizing pathologic information and weighted t-statistics. Although a transcriptional contribution from the stromal cell fraction is detectable in microarray experiments performed on bulk tumor, the gene expression differences between the distant metastasis and no distant metastasis group were mostly ascribed to the tumor epithelial cells of the primary breast tumors. However, the gene {PIP}5K2A was found significantly elevated in stroma cells in distant metastasis group, compared to stroma in no distant metastasis group. These findings were confirmed in gene expression data from the representative compartments from microdissected breast tissue. The method described was also found to be robust to different histopathological procedures.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0057799},
	abstract = {Although ovarian cancer is often initially chemotherapy-sensitive, the vast majority of tumors eventually relapse and patients die of increasingly aggressive disease. Cancer stem cells are believed to have properties that allow them to survive therapy and may drive recurrent tumor growth. Cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells are a rare cell population and difficult to isolate experimentally. Genes that are expressed by stem cells may characterize a subset of less differentiated tumors and aid in prognostic classification of ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was the genomic identification and characterization of a subtype of ovarian cancer that has stem cell-like gene expression. Using human and mouse gene signatures of embryonic, adult, or cancer stem cells, we performed an unsupervised bipartition class discovery on expression profiles from 145 serous ovarian tumors to identify a stem-like and more differentiated subgroup. Subtypes were reproducible and were further characterized in four independent, heterogeneous ovarian cancer datasets. We identified a stem-like subtype characterized by a 51-gene signature, which is significantly enriched in tumors with properties of Type {II} ovarian cancer; high grade, serous tumors, and poor survival. Conversely, the differentiated tumors share properties with Type I, including lower grade and mixed histological subtypes. The stem cell-like signature was prognostic within high-stage serous ovarian cancer, classifying a small subset of high-stage tumors with better prognosis, in the differentiated subtype. In multivariate models that adjusted for common clinical factors (including grade, stage, age), the subtype classification was still a significant predictor of relapse. The prognostic stem-like gene signature yields new insights into prognostic differences in ovarian cancer, provides a genomic context for defining Type I/{II} subtypes, and potential gene targets which following further validation may be valuable in the clinical management or treatment of ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Tumor cells express programmed death ligand 1 ({PD}-L1) and is a key immune evasion mechanism. {PD}-L1 expression in multiple breast cancer cell lines was evaluated to identify intrinsic differences that affect their potential for immune evasion.
{METHODS}: {PD}-L1 expression was analyzed in six breast cancer cell lines: {AU}565\&{MCF}7 (luminal), {BT}20\&{HCC}1143 (basal A), {MDA}231\&{HCC}38 (basal B). Surface and intracellular {PD}-L1 expression +/- interferon γ for 48 hours was measured by flow cytometry. {PD}-L1 gene expression data for all breast cancer cell lines in the Comprehensive Cell Line Encyclopedia ({CCLE}) was analyzed. Correlation between {PD}-L1 levels and clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed within Oncomine datasets. A tissue microarray containing 61 invasive breast cancer primary tumor cores was stained for {PD}-L1 expression and analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Basal breast cancer cells constitutively express the highest levels of {PD}-L1. All cell lines increased {PD}-L1 expression with interferon γ, but basal B cells ({MDA}-231 and {HCC}38) demonstrated the largest increases. There were no differences in protein localization between cell lines. In the {CCLE} data, basal cell lines demonstrated higher mean {PD}-L1 expression compared to luminal cell lines. High {PD}-L1 expressing basal cell lines over-express genes involved in invasion, proliferation, and chemoresistance compared to low {PD}-L1 basal cell lines. High {PD}-L1 basal cell lines had lower expression of {IRF}2BP2 and higher {STAT}1 levels compared to low {PD}-L1 expressing cell lines. Within Oncomine datasets {PDL}1 {mRNA} levels were higher in basal type tumors. The {TMA} analysis demonstrated that lymph node positive cases had higher levels of {PD}-L1 protein expression compared to lymph node negative cases.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Basal type breast cancer (especially basal B) express greater levels of {PD}-L1 constitutively and with {IFN} γ. High {PD}-L1 basal cells over-express genes involved in invasion, motility, and chemoresistance. Targeting {PD}-L1 may enhance eradication of aggressive breast cancer cells by the immune system.},

	abstract = {Breast milk is a complex liquid with immune-competent cells and soluble proteins that provide immunity to the infant and affect the maturation of the infant's immune system. Exosomes are nanovesicles (30-100 nm) with an endosome-derived limiting membrane secreted by a diverse range of cell types. Because exosomes carry immunorelevant structures, they are suggested to participate in directing the immune response. We hypothesized that human breast milk contain exosomes, which may be important for the development of the infant's immune system. We isolated vesicles from the human colostrum and mature breast milk by ultracentrifugations and/or immuno-isolation on paramagnetic beads. We found that the vesicles displayed a typical exosome-like size and morphology as analyzed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, they floated at a density between 1.10 and 1.18 g/ml in a sucrose gradient, corresponding to the known density of exosomes. In addition, {MHC} classes I and {II}, {CD}63, {CD}81, and {CD}86 were detected on the vesicles by flow cytometry. Western blot and mass spectrometry further confirmed the presence of several exosome-associated molecules. Functional analysis revealed that the vesicle preparation inhibited anti-{CD}3-induced {IL}-2 and {IFN}-gamma production from allogeneic and autologous {PBMC}. In addition, an increased number of Foxp3(+){CD}4(+){CD}25(+) T regulatory cells were observed in {PBMC} incubated with milk vesicle preparations. We conclude that human breast milk contains exosomes with the capacity to influence immune responses.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas ({IDC} and {ILC}) are the most common histological types of breast cancer. Clinical follow-up data and metastatic patterns suggest that the development and progression of these tumors are different. The aim of our study was to identify gene expression profiles of {IDC} and {ILC} in relation to normal breast epithelial cells. {METHODS}: We examined 30 samples (normal ductal and lobular cells from 10 patients, {IDC} cells from 5 patients, {ILC} cells from 5 patients) microdissected from cryosections of ten mastectomy specimens from postmenopausal patients. Fifty nanograms of total {RNA} were amplified and labeled by {PCR} and in vitro transcription. Samples were analysed upon Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. The expression of seven differentially expressed genes ({CDH}1, {EMP}1, {DDR}1, {DVL}1, {KRT}5, {KRT}6, {KRT}17) was verified by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Expression of {ASPN} {mRNA} was validated by in situ hybridization on frozen sections, and {CTHRC}1, {ASPN} and {COL}3A1 were tested by {PCR}. {RESULTS}: Using {GCOS} pairwise comparison algorithm and rank products we have identified 84 named genes common to {ILC} versus normal cell types, 74 named genes common to {IDC} versus normal cell types, 78 named genes differentially expressed between normal ductal and lobular cells, and 28 named genes between {IDC} and {ILC}. Genes distinguishing between {IDC} and {ILC} are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, {TGF}-beta and Wnt signaling. These changes were present in both tumor types but appeared to be more prominent in {ILC}. Immunohistochemistry for several novel markers ({EMP}1, {DVL}1, {DDR}1) distinguished large sets of {IDC} from {ILC}. {CONCLUSION}: {IDC} and {ILC} can be differentiated both at the gene and protein levels. In this study we report two candidate genes, asporin ({ASPN}) and collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 ({CTHRC}1) which might be significant in breast carcinogenesis. Besides E-cadherin, the proteins validated on tissue microarrays ({EMP}1, {DVL}1, {DDR}1) may represent novel immunohistochemical markers helpful in distinguishing between {IDC} and {ILC}. Further studies with larger sets of patients are needed to verify the gene expression profiles of various histological types of breast cancer in order to determine molecular subclassifications, prognosis and the optimum treatment strategies.},

Attempts to better define variation amongst breast tumours have led to the definition of four main "intrinsic" subtypes of breast cancer with two of these classes, Luminal A and B, composed almost entirely of {ER}+ve cancers. In this study we set out to investigate the significance of intrinsic subtypes within a group of {ER}+ve breast cancers treated with neoadjuvant anastrozole. {RNA} from tumour biopsies taken from 104 postmenopausal women before and after 2 weeks treatment with anastrozole was analyzed on Illumina 48K microarrays. Gene-expression based subtypes and risk of relapse ({ROR}) scores for tumours pre- and post-treatment were determined using the {PAM}50 method. Amongst pre-treatment samples, all intrinsic subtypes were found to be present, although luminal groups were represented most highly. Luminal A and B tumours obtained similar benefit from treatment, as measured by the proportional fall in the proliferation marker Ki67 upon treatment (mean suppression=75.5\% vs 75.7\%). Tumours classified as basal and Her2-like showed poor reductions in Ki67 upon treatment. Residual Ki67 staining after two weeks remained higher in the Luminal B group. {ROR} score was significantly associated with anti-proliferative response to {AI} and with clinical response. These results suggest that in the short-term, Luminal A and B tumours may gain similar benefit from an {AI} but that the higher residual Ki67 level seen in Luminal B is indicative of poorer long term outcome.},

	abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization is a useful tool for reducing the dimension of large datasets. This work considers simultaneous non-negative matrix factorization of multiple sources of data. In particular, we perform the first study that involves more than two datasets. We discuss the algorithmic issues required to convert the approach into a practical computational tool and apply the technique to new gene expression data quantifying the molecular changes in four tissue types due to different dosages of an experimental {panPPAR} agonist in mouse. This study is of interest in toxicology because, whilst {PPARs} form potential therapeutic targets for diabetes, it is known that they can induce serious side-effects. Our results show that the practical simultaneous non-negative matrix factorization developed here can add value to the data analysis. In particular, we find that factorizing the data as a single object allows us to distinguish between the four tissue types, but does not correctly reproduce the known dosage level groups. Applying our new approach, which treats the four tissue types as providing distinct, but related, datasets, we find that the dosage level groups are respected. The new algorithm then provides separate gene list orderings that can be studied for each tissue type, and compared with the ordering arising from the single factorization. We find that many of our conclusions can be corroborated with known biological behaviour, and others offer new insights into the toxicological effects. Overall, the algorithm shows promise for early detection of toxicity in the drug discovery process.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: We aimed to identify mechanisms driving local recurrence in a model of breast-conserving surgery ({BCS}) for breast cancer.
{BACKGROUND}: Breast cancer recurrence after {BCS} remains a clinically significant, but poorly understood problem. We have previously reported that recurrent colorectal tumours demonstrate altered growth dynamics, increased metastatic burden and resistance to apoptosis, mediated by upregulation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt ({PI}3K/Akt). We investigated whether similar characteristics were evident in a model of locally recurrent breast cancer.
{METHODS}: Tumours were generated by orthotopic inoculation of 4T1 cells in two groups of female Balb/c mice and cytoreductive surgery performed when mean tumour size was above 150 mm(3). Local recurrence was observed and gene expression was examined using Affymetrix {GeneChips} in primary and recurrent tumours. Differential expression was confirmed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ({qRT}-{PCR}). Phosphorylation of Akt was assessed using Western immunoblotting. An ex vivo heat shock protein ({HSP})-loaded dendritic cell vaccine was administered in the perioperative period.
{RESULTS}: We observed a significant difference in the recurrent 4T1 tumour volume and growth rate (p {\textless} 0.05). Gene expression studies suggested roles for the {PI}3K/Akt system and local immunosuppression driving the altered growth kinetics. We demonstrated that perioperative vaccination with an ex vivo {HSP}-loaded dendritic cell vaccine abrogated recurrent tumour growth in vivo (p = 0.003 at day 15).
{CONCLUSION}: Investigating therapies which target tumour survival pathways such as {PI}3K/Akt and boost immune surveillance in the perioperative period may be useful adjuncts to contemporary breast cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {In cancer studies with high-throughput genetic and genomic measurements, integrative analysis provides a way to effectively pool and analyze heterogeneous raw data from multiple independent studies and outperforms "classic" meta-analysis and single-dataset analysis. When marker selection is of interest, the genetic basis of multiple datasets can be described using the homogeneity model or the heterogeneity model. In this study, we consider marker selection under the heterogeneity model, which includes the homogeneity model as a special case and can be more flexible. Penalization methods have been developed in the literature for marker selection. This study advances from the published ones by introducing the contrast penalties, which can accommodate the within- and across-dataset structures of covariates/regression coefficients and, by doing so, further improve marker selection performance. Specifically, we develop a penalization method that accommodates the across-dataset structures by smoothing over regression coefficients. An effective iterative algorithm, which calls an inner coordinate descent iteration, is developed. Simulation shows that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark with more accurate marker identification. The analysis of breast cancer and lung cancer prognosis studies with gene expression measurements shows that the proposed method identifies genes different from those using the benchmark and has better prediction performance.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent not used routinely for breast cancer treatment. As a {DNA} cross-linking agent, cisplatin may be effective treatment for hereditary {BRCA}1-mutated breast cancers. Because sporadic triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}) and {BRCA}1-associated breast cancer share features suggesting common pathogenesis, we conducted a neoadjuvant trial of cisplatin in {TNBC} and explored specific biomarkers to identify predictors of response. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS} Twenty-eight women with stage {II} or {III} breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors and {HER}2/Neu ({TNBC}) were enrolled and treated with four cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. After definitive surgery, patients received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy per their treating physicians. Clinical and pathologic treatment response were assessed, and pretreatment tumor samples were evaluated for selected biomarkers. Results Six (22\%) of 28 patients achieved pathologic complete responses, including both patients with {BRCA}1 germline mutations;18 (64\%) patients had a clinical complete or partial response. Fourteen (50\%) patients showed good pathologic responses (Miller-Payne score of 3, 4, or 5), 10 had minor responses (Miller-Payne score of 1 or 2), and four (14\%) progressed. All {TNBCs} clustered with reference basal-like tumors by hierarchical clustering. Factors associated with good cisplatin response include young age (P = .001), low {BRCA}1 {mRNA} expression (P = .03), {BRCA}1 promoter methylation (P = .04), p53 nonsense or frameshift mutations (P = .01), and a gene expression signature of E2F3 activation (P = .03). {CONCLUSION} Single-agent cisplatin induced response in a subset of patients with {TNBC}. Decreased {BRCA}1 expression may identify subsets of {TNBCs} that are cisplatin sensitive. Other biomarkers show promise in predicting cisplatin response.},

Since the publication of the first signature in the late 90s, high-throughput gene expression analysis has revolutionised genetics over the last 15years. The scientific community has used this new technology to find responses to these fundamental questions; from understanding tumour biology, to prediction of progression, and treatments to which it will respond. Nevertheless, legitimate excitement about the attractiveness of molecular technologies and the promise of discovery-based research should not overlook adherence to the rules of evidence, otherwise it may result in claims that are not meaningful and lead to disappointment. This review will thus focus on the approaches developed to answer these three fundamental questions and the results evidenced both at biological and clinical level. On looking at this huge amount of data that have become increasingly minute, and at times contradictory, we discuss how gene expression signature improve our understanding of cancer biology, our ability to predict progression and response, and finally, our capacity to treat cancers more efficiently.},

Notably, although {PALB}2 alone stimulates D-loop formation, it has a cooperative effect with {RAD}51AP1, an enhancer of {RAD}51. This stimulation stems from the ability of {PALB}2 to function with {RAD}51 and {RAD}51AP1 to assemble the synaptic complex. Our results demonstrate the multifaceted role of {PALB}2 in chromosome damage repair.

More recently they were reported as vectors of {mRNAs}, {miRNAs} and also lipid mediators able to act on target cells. They are the only type of vesicles released from an intracellular compartment from cells in viable conditions. They appear as a vectorized signaling system operating from inside a donor cell towards either the periphery, the cytosol, or possibly to the nucleus of target cells. Exosomes from normal cells trigger positive effects, whereas those from pathological ones, such as tumor cells or infected ones may trigger non-positive health effects. Therefore regulating the biogenesis and secretion of exosomes appear as a pharmacological challenge to intervene in various pathophysiologies. Exosome biogenesis and molecular content, interaction with target cells, utilisation as biomarkers, and functional effects in various pathophysiologies are considered in this review.},

However, all patients eventually become resistant and a substantial percentage experience immediate disease progression with first-line targeted therapy. In addition, patients have variable clinical benefit and/or tolerance to different agents, including drugs within the same class. Thus, the choice of therapy for an individual patient remains empiric at present. Upon this landscape, several molecular biomarkers have been investigated with the purpose of guiding therapy. This review discusses prognostic biomarkers correlating with the outcome of patients independent of therapy, and predictive biomarkers of treatment response, including circulating biomarkers (such as {VEGF} and {VEGF}-related proteins, cytokine and angiogenic factors, and lactate dehydrogenase), and tissue-based biomarkers (such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms). Many potential prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers have now been identified in {RCC}, although none has yet entered into clinical practice, and all require prospective validation in appropriately designed randomized studies. In the near future, however, validated biomarkers may become integral to management strategies in {RCC}, enabling tailored treatment for individual patients to improve clinical outcomes.},

	title = {Nearest Neighbor Networks: clustering expression data based on gene neighborhoods.},
	volume = {8},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The availability of microarrays measuring thousands of genes simultaneously across hundreds of biological conditions represents an opportunity to understand both individual biological pathways and the integrated workings of the cell. However, translating this amount of data into biological insight remains a daunting task. An important initial step in the analysis of microarray data is clustering of genes with similar behavior. A number of classical techniques are commonly used to perform this task, particularly hierarchical and K-means clustering, and many novel approaches have been suggested recently. While these approaches are useful, they are not without drawbacks; these methods can find clusters in purely random data, and even clusters enriched for biological functions can be skewed towards a small number of processes (e.g. ribosomes). {RESULTS}: We developed Nearest Neighbor Networks ({NNN}), a graph-based algorithm to generate clusters of genes with similar expression profiles. This method produces clusters based on overlapping cliques within an interaction network generated from mutual nearest neighborhoods. This focus on nearest neighbors rather than on absolute distance measures allows us to capture clusters with high connectivity even when they are spatially separated, and requiring mutual nearest neighbors allows genes with no sufficiently similar partners to remain unclustered. We compared the clusters generated by {NNN} with those generated by eight other clustering methods. {NNN} was particularly successful at generating functionally coherent clusters with high precision, and these clusters generally represented a much broader selection of biological processes than those recovered by other methods. {CONCLUSION}: The Nearest Neighbor Networks algorithm is a valuable clustering method that effectively groups genes that are likely to be functionally related. It is particularly attractive due to its simplicity, its success in the analysis of large datasets, and its ability to span a wide range of biological functions with high precision.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) routinely apply principal component analysis ({PCA}) to infer population structure within a sample to correct for confounding due to ancestry. {GWAS} implementation of {PCA} uses tens of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) to infer structure, despite the fact that only a small fraction of such {SNPs} provides useful information on ancestry. The identification of this reduced set of ancestry-informative markers ({AIMs}) from a {GWAS} has practical value; for example, researchers can genotype the {AIM} set to correct for potential confounding due to ancestry in follow-up studies that utilize custom {SNP} or sequencing technology. We propose a novel technique to identify {AIMs} from genome-wide {SNP} data using sparse {PCA}. The procedure uses penalized regression methods to identify those {SNPs} in a genome-wide panel that significantly contribute to the principal components while encouraging {SNPs} that provide negligible loadings to vanish from the analysis. We found that sparse {PCA} leads to negligible loss of ancestry information compared to traditional {PCA} analysis of genome-wide {SNP} data. We further demonstrate the value of sparse {PCA} for {AIM} selection using real data from the International {HapMap} Project and a genomewide study of inflammatory bowel disease.

	abstract = {The hypoxic microenvironment of bone marrow favours the bone metastasis process. Hypoxia inducible factor ({HIF})-1α is hallmark for hypoxia, correlating with poor prognosis and radio/chemotherapy resistance of primary-breast carcinoma. For bone metastasis, the molecular mechanisms involved in {HIF}-1α expression and {HIF}-1 (α/β heterodimer)-transcription factor activity are scarcely known. We studied the role played by {HIF}-1 in the cross-talk between neoplastic and supportive-microenvironmental cells. Also, {WWdomain}-containing oxidoreductase (Wwox) and transcriptional co-activator with {PDZ}-binding motif ({TAZ}) were taken into consideration evaluating whether these Hippo-pathway effectors affect bone-metastatic phenotype through {HIF}-1 activity. Considering bone-metastasis specimens, nuclear {HIF}-1α-{TAZ} co-localisation occurred in neoplastic and supportive cells, such as fibroblasts and endotheliocytes. Based on these data, the functional importance was verified using 1833-bone metastatic clone under hypoxia: nuclear {HIF}-1α and {TAZ} expression increased and co-immunoprecipitated, activating {HIF}-1-{DNA} binding and transactivation. In contrast, Wwox localised at perinuclear level in neoplastic cells of bone metastasis, being almost absent in supportive cells, and Wwox-protein expression diminished in hypoxic-1833 cells. Thus, {TAZ} regulation of {HIF}-1 activity might be important for bone-secondary growth, participating in metastasis-stroma cross-talk. Further, {TAZ} and {HIF}-1α-protein levels seemed correlated. In fact, blocking cyclooxygenase-2 with {NS}398 in hypoxic-1833 cells, not only {HIF}-1α decreased but also molecular-mechanism(s) upstream of the Hippo pathway were triggered: {LATS}-dependent {TAZ} phosphorylation seemed responsible for {TAZ} nucleus/cytoplasm translocation and degradation. In the 1833-xenograft model, {NS}398 largely prevented the outgrowth of bone-metastatic cells, probably related to remarkable-extracellular matrix assembly. We gained clinical insight into {HIF}-1α and {TAZ} as candidate biomarkers for bone avidity, relevant for early-therapeutic intervention against bone metastasis.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}

Many pathway analysis (or gene set enrichment analysis) methods have been developed to identify enriched pathways under different biological states within a genomic study. As more and more microarray datasets accumulate, meta-analysis methods have also been developed to integrate information among multiple studies. Currently, most meta-analysis methods for combining genomic studies focus on biomarker detection and meta-analysis for pathway analysis has not been systematically pursued.


{RESULTS}

We investigated two approaches of meta-analysis for pathway enrichment ({MAPE}) by combining statistical significance across studies at the gene level ({MAPE}\_G) or at the pathway level ({MAPE}\_P). Simulation results showed increased statistical power of meta-analysis approaches compared to a single study analysis and showed complementary advantages of {MAPE}\_G and {MAPE}\_P under different scenarios. We also developed an integrated method ({MAPE}\_I) that incorporates advantages of both approaches. Comprehensive simulations and applications to real data on drug response of breast cancer cell lines and lung cancer tissues were evaluated to compare the performance of three {MAPE} variations. {MAPE}\_P has the advantage of not requiring gene matching across studies. When {MAPE}\_G and {MAPE}\_P show complementary advantages, the hybrid version of {MAPE}\_I is generally recommended.

Between 1987 and 1995, 457 patients with invasive T2{\textgreater}3 cm-T4 breast carcinomas were treated with primary chemotherapy ({CT}), surgery, radiation therapy. Clinical response, the possibility of breast preservation, pathological response and survival were evaluated according to the histological type. In order to evaluate the biological differences between {ILC} and {IDC} patients and their implication with regard to tumour chemosensitivity, additional immunohistochemical stainings (oestrogen receptor ({ER}), Bcl2, p53, c-{erbB}-2 and Ki67) were performed on 129 pretherapeutical specimens. 38 (8.3\%) {ILC} were diagnosed by core needle biopsy before {CT}. {ILC} was an independent predictor of a poor clinical response (P=0.02) and ineligibility for breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.03). Histological and biological factors predicting a poor response to {CT} (histological grade, {ER}, Ki67 and p53 status) were more frequent in {ILC} than in {IDC} patients. After a median follow-up of 98 months (range: 3-166), the low chemosensitivity of {ILC} did not result in a survival disadvantage. Our results demonstrate that {ILC} achieved a lower response to {CT} than {IDC} because of their immunohistochemical profile. Preoperative {CT} did not allow a high rate of conservative treatment for {ILC} and therefore the use of neoadjuvant {CT} for {ILC} patients should be questioned.},

	abstract = {Batch process performance monitoring has been achieved primarily using process measurements with the extracted information being associated with the physical parameters of the process. With increasing attention now being paid to the application of on-line real-time process analytics through spectrometry, together with the {FDA} Process Analytical Technologies ({PAT}) initiative, the use of spectroscopic information for enhanced monitoring of reactions is gaining impetus. The harmonious integration of process data and spectroscopic data then becomes a major challenge. By integrating the process and spectroscopic measurements for multivariate statistical data modelling and analysis, it is conjectured that improved process understanding and fault diagnosis can be achieved. An investigation into combining process and spectral data using multiblock and multiresolution analysis is proposed and the results from the analysis of experimental data from two industrial application studies are presented to demonstrate the improvements achievable in terms of process performance monitoring and fault diagnosis.

Somatic mutations in only three genes ({TP}53, {PIK}3CA and {GATA}3) occurred at {\textgreater}10\% incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in {GATA}3, {PIK}3CA and {MAP}3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a {HER}2/phosphorylated {HER}2/{EGFR}/phosphorylated {EGFR} signature within the {HER}2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cross-validation ({CV}) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the {CV} error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the {CV} error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data. {RESULTS}: We used {CV} to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines ({SVM}). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these "null" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the {CV} error estimate. 10-fold {CV} was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-{CV} ({LOOCV}) was used for the {SVM}. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With "null" and "non null" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested {CV} procedure, where an inner {CV} loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer {CV} is used to compute an estimate of the error. The {CV} error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the "null" datasets, the {CV} error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30\% on 18.5\% of simulated training data-sets. For {SVM} with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30\% on 38\% of "null" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance. The nested {CV} procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and {SVM} classifiers for "null" and "non-null" data distributions. {CONCLUSION}: We show that using {CV} to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using {CV} gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of {CV} for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each {CV} loop. A nested {CV} procedure provides an almost unbiased estimate of the true error.},

Linear multivariate methods for relating two set of variables, such as two-block Partial Least Squares ({PLS}2), canonical correlation analysis and redundancy analysis, are less suited for this purpose because habitat preferences are often unimodal functions of habitat variables. After pointing out the key assumptions underlying {CCA}, the paper focuses on the interpretation of {CCA} ordination diagrams. Subsequently, some advanced uses, such as ranking environmental variables in importance and the statistical testing of effects are illustrated on a typical macroinvertebrate data-set. The paper closes with comparisons with correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis, {PLS}2 and co-inertia analysis.

For real data of which the dimensionality is unknown, the minimum spanning tree can provide a useful means of estimating this dimensionality. Nonmetric multidemensional scaling was also less susceptible to distortion of the ordination by single gradients of high beta diversity and two-gradient situations when each gradient is of a different beta diversity. A number of different similarity measures were evaluated for use in conjunction with nonmetric scaling and the cos theta coefficient was found to generally give good results.

Mature and aged male and female New Zealand White rabbits were used for in situ blood perfused cardiopulmonary bypass. Control hearts received 30 min sham ischemia and 120 min sham reperfusion. Global ischemia ({GI}) hearts received 30 min of {GI} achieved by cross-clamping of the aorta. Cardioplegia ({CP}) hearts received cold blood cardioplegia prior to {GI}. Following 30 min of {GI} the hearts were reperfused for 120 min and then used for {RNA} and protein isolation. Microarray and proteomic analyses were performed. Functional enrichment analysis showed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and calcium signaling pathways were significantly enriched in all experimental groups. Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway were significantly changed in the aged male only (P {\textless} 0.05), while glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism was significant in the aged female only (P {\textless} 0.05). Our data show that specific pathways associated with the mitochondrion modulate cardioprotection with {CP} in the aged and specifically in the aged female. The alteration of these pathways significantly contributes to decreased myocardial functional recovery and myonecrosis following ischemia and may be modulated to allow for enhanced cardioprotection in the aged and specifically in the aged female.},

	abstract = {Most methods for the interpretation of gene expression profiling experiments rely on the categorization of genes, as provided by the Gene Ontology ({GO}) and pathway databases. Due to the manual curation process, such databases are never up-to-date and tend to be limited in focus and coverage. Automated literature mining tools provide an attractive, alternative approach. We review how they can be employed for the interpretation of gene expression profiling experiments. We illustrate that their comprehensive scope aids the interpretation of data from domains poorly covered by {GO} or alternative databases, and allows for the linking of gene expression with diseases, drugs, tissues and other types of concepts. A framework for proper statistical evaluation of the associations between gene expression values and literature concepts was lacking and is now implemented in a weighted extension of global test. The weights are the literature association scores and reflect the importance of a gene for the concept of interest. In a direct comparison with classical {GO}-based gene sets, we show that use of literature-based associations results in the identification of much more specific {GO} categories. We demonstrate the possibilities for linking of gene expression data to patient survival in breast cancer and the action and metabolism of drugs. Coupling with online literature mining tools ensures transparency and allows further study of the identified associations. Literature mining tools are therefore powerful additions to the toolbox for the interpretation of high-throughput genomics data.},

	abstract = {The immune system influences the fate of developing cancers by not only functioning as a tumour promoter that facilitates cellular transformation, promotes tumour growth and sculpts tumour cell immunogenicity, but also as an extrinsic tumour suppressor that either destroys developing tumours or restrains their expansion. Yet, clinically apparent cancers still arise in immunocompetent individuals in part as a consequence of cancer-induced immunosuppression. In many individuals, immunosuppression is mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 ({CTLA}-4) and programmed death-1 ({PD}-1), two immunomodulatory receptors expressed on T cells. Monoclonal-antibody-based therapies targeting {CTLA}-4 and/or {PD}-1 (checkpoint blockade) have yielded significant clinical benefits—including durable responses—to patients with different malignancies. However, little is known about the identity of the tumour antigens that function as the targets of T cells activated by checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and whether these antigens can be used to generate vaccines that are highly tumour-specific. Here we use genomics and bioinformatics approaches to identify tumour-specific mutant proteins as a major class of T-cell rejection antigens following anti-{PD}-1 and/or anti-{CTLA}-4 therapy of mice bearing progressively growing sarcomas, and we show that therapeutic synthetic long-peptide vaccines incorporating these mutant epitopes induce tumour rejection comparably to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Although mutant tumour-antigen-specific T cells are present in progressively growing tumours, they are reactivated following treatment with anti-{PD}-1 and/or anti-{CTLA}-4 and display some overlapping but mostly treatment-specific transcriptional profiles, rendering them capable of mediating tumour rejection. These results reveal that tumour-specific mutant antigens are not only important targets of checkpoint blockade therapy, but they can also be used to develop personalized cancer-specific vaccines and to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of different checkpoint blockade treatments.},

We have previously screened for new markers for brain metastasis by array {CGH}. We found that loss of 11p15 is common among these patients. In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of loss of 11p15 in primary breast cancer ({BC}) and breast cancer brain metastases ({BCBM}). 11p15 aberration patterns were assessed by allelic imbalance ({AI}) analysis in primary {BC} (n = 78), {BCBM} (n = 21) and metastases from other distant sites (n = 6) using six different markers. {AI} at 11p15 was significantly associated with {BCBM} (p = 0.002). Interestingly, a subgroup of primary {BC} with a later relapse to the brain had almost equally high {AI} rates as the {BCBM} cases. In primary {BC}, {AI} was statistically significantly associated with high grade, negative hormone receptor status, and triple-negative ({TNBC}) tumors. Gene expression profiling identified {PRKCDBP} in the 11p15 region to be significantly downregulated in both {BCBM} and primary {BC} with brain relapse compared to primary tumors without relapse or bone metastasis (fdr{\textless}0.05). {qRT}-{PCR} confirmed these results and methylation was shown to be a common way to silence this gene. In conclusion, we found loss at 11p15 to be a marker for {TNBC} primary tumors and {BCBM} and {PRKCDBP} to be a potential target gene in this locus.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Infection with dengue viruses ({DENV}) leads to a spectrum of disease outcomes. The pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of {DENV} infection may be driven by host responses, which could be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells. {METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: We conducted genome-wide microarray analysis of whole blood {RNA} from 34 {DENV}-infected children in Nicaragua collected on days 3-6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In the dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, one subset of differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. By performing a meta-analysis of our dataset in conjunction with previously published datasets, we confirmed that {DENV} infection in vivo is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Additionally, whereas in vitro infection leads to an increased interferon signature, this was not consistently observed from in vivo patient samples, suggesting that the interferon response in vivo is relatively transient and was no longer observed by days 3-6 of illness. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: These data highlight important differences between different manifestations of severity during {DENV} infection as well as identify some commonalities. Compilation of larger datasets in the future across multiple studies, as we have initiated in this report, may well lead to better prediction of disease manifestation via a systems biology approach.},

Based on decomposition of the large data matrix, the first level {PCR} model divides the process into different sub-blocks through uncorrelated principal component directions, with a related index defined for determination of variables in each sub-block. In the second level, a {PCR} model is developed for local quality prediction in each sub-block. Subsequently, the third level {PCR} model is constructed to combine the local prediction results in different sub-blocks. For process analysis, a sub-block contribution index is defined to identify the critical-to-quality sub-blocks, based on which an inside sub-block contribution index is further defined for determination of the key variables in each sub-block. As a result, correlations between process variables and quality variables can be successfully constructed.

We hypothesized that in ovarian carcinoma patients exosomes initially produced at the local abdominal site may become systemic. We examined paired samples of ascites and blood from ovarian carcinoma patients for the presence of exosomes. We also studied the requirements for exosomal uptake by immune cells, the role of phosphatidyl-serine ({PS}) as uptake signal and the effect of exosome application on tumor growth. We used exosomes from ovarian carcinoma cell lines, malignant ascites and sera from ovarian carcinoma patients isolated by ultracentrifugation. {PS}-displayed by exosomes was detected by Anexin-V-{FITC} staining of latex beads adsorbed exosomes. For uptake experiments, labeled exosomes were exposed to cells in the presence or absence of cold Annexin-V as competitor. Uptake was examined by fluorescent microscopy and cytofluorographic analysis. Effects of exosomes on tumor growth were studied using {SKOV}3ip ovarian carcinoma cells in {CD}1 nu/nu mice. We found that malignant ascites-derived exosomes cargo tumor progression related proteins such as L1CAM, {CD}24, {ADAM}10, and {EMMPRIN}. We observed that exosomes become systemic via the blood stream. Uptake of ovarian carcinoma exosomes by {NK} cells was found to require {PS} at the exosomal surface but the presence of {PS} was not sufficient. Application of malignant ascites-derived exosomes to tumor bearing mice resulted in augmented tumor growth. Exosomes from the serum of tumor patients could be isolated from only one ml of blood and this analysis could serve for diagnostic purposes. We propose that tumor-derived exosomes could play a role in tumor progression.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {RAS} and {PIK}3CA mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer ({mCRC}) have been associated with worse survival. We sought to evaluate the impact of {RAS} and {PIK}3CA mutations on cumulative incidence of metastasis to potentially curable sites of liver and lung and other sites such as bone and brain.
{METHODS}: We performed a computerized search of the electronic medical record of our institution for {mCRC} cases genotyped for {RAS} or {PIK}3CA mutations from 2008 to 2012. Cases were reviewed for patient characteristics, survival, and site-specific metastasis.
{RESULTS}: Among the 918 patients identified, 477 cases were {RAS} wild type, and 441 cases had a {RAS} mutation (394 at {KRAS} exon 2, 29 at {KRAS} exon 3 or 4, and 18 in {NRAS}). {RAS} mutation was significantly associated with shorter median overall survival ({OS}) and on multivariate analysis independently predicted worse {OS} ({HR}, 1.6; P {\textless} .01). {RAS} mutant {mCRC} exhibited a significantly higher cumulative incidence of lung, bone, and brain metastasis and on multivariate analysis was an independent predictor of involvement of these sites ({HR}, 1.5, 1.6, and 3.7, respectively). {PIK}3CA mutations occurred in 10\% of the 786 cases genotyped, did not predict for worse survival, and did not exhibit a site-specific pattern of metastatic spread.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The metastatic potential of {CRC} varies with the presence of {RAS} mutation. {RAS} mutation is associated with worse {OS} and increased incidence of lung, bone, and brain metastasis. An understanding of this site-specific pattern of spread may help to inform physicians' assessment of symptoms in patients with {mCRC}. Cancer 2014. © 2014 American Cancer Society.},

The large body of available gene expression data has also allowed us to define the of coordinately expressed genes, termed gene expression signatures, which characterize the states of cellular physiology that reflect cellular differentiation, activation of signaling pathways, and the action of transcription factors. Gene expression signatures that reflect the action of individual transcription factors can be defined by perturbing transcription factor function using {RNA} interference ({RNAi}), small-molecule inhibition, and dominant-negative approaches. We have used this methodology to define gene expression signatures of various transcription factors controlling B-cell differentiation and activation, including {BCL}-6, B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), X-box binding protein-1 ({XBP}1), nuclear factor-{kappaB} ({NF}-{kappaB}), and c-myc. We have also curated a wide variety of gene expression signatures from the literature and assembled these into a signature database. Statistical methods can define whether any signature in this database is differentially expressed in independent biological samples, an approach we have used to gain mechanistic insights into the origin and clinical behavior of B-cell lymphomas. We also discuss the use of genomic-scale {RNAi} libraries to identify genes and pathways that may serve as therapeutic targets in B-cell malignancies.},

	abstract = {Normal-appearing epithelium of cancer patients can harbor occult genetic abnormalities. Data comprehensively comparing gene expression between histologically normal breast epithelium of breast cancer patients and cancer-free controls are limited. The present study compares global gene expression between these groups. We performed microarrays using {RNA} from microdissected histologically normal terminal ductal-lobular units ({TDLU}) from 2 groups: (i) cancer normal ({CN}) ({TDLUs} adjacent to untreated {ER}+ breast cancers (n = 14)) and (ii) reduction mammoplasty ({RM}) ({TDLUs} of age-matched women without breast disease (n = 15)). Cyber-T identified differentially expressed genes. Quantitative {RT}-{PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}), immunohistochemistry ({IHC}), and comparison to independent microarray data including 6 carcinomas in situ ({CIS}), validated the results. Gene ontology ({GO}), {UniProt} and published literature evaluated gene function. About 127 probesets, corresponding to 105 genes, were differentially expressed between {CN} and {RM} (p {\textless} 0.0009, corresponding to {FDR} {\textless}0.10). 104/127 (82\%) probesets were also differentially expressed between {CIS} and {RM}, nearly always (102/104 (98\%)) in the same direction as in {CN} vs. {RM}. Two-thirds of the 105 genes were implicated previously in carcinogenesis. Overrepresented functional groups included transcription, G-protein coupled and chemokine receptor activity, the {MAPK} cascade and immediate early genes. Most genes in these categories were under-expressed in {CN} vs. {RM}. We conclude that global gene expression abnormalities exist in normal epithelium of breast cancer patients and are also present in early cancers. Thus, cancer-related pathways may be perturbed in normal epithelium. These abnormalities could be markers of disease risk, occult disease, or the tissue's response to an existing tumor.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis ({WGCNA}) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. {RESULTS}: The {WGCNA} R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. {CONCLUSION}: The {WGCNA} package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/{CoexpressionNetwork}/Rpackages/{WGCNA}.},

Recent proteomic analyses have shown that the nucleolus contains proteins involved in cell cycle control, {DNA} processing and {DNA} damage response and repair, in addition to the many proteins connected with ribosome subunit production. Here we study the dynamics of nucleolar protein responses in cells exposed to stress and {DNA} damage caused by ionizing and ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation in diploid human fibroblasts. We show using a combination of imaging and quantitative proteomics methods that nucleolar substructure and the nucleolar proteome undergo selective reorganization in response to {UV} damage. The proteomic responses to {UV} include alterations of functional protein complexes such as the {SSU} processome and exosome, and paraspeckle proteins, involving both decreases and increases in steady state protein ratios, respectively. Several nonhomologous end-joining proteins ({NHEJ}), such as Ku70/80, display similar fast responses to {UV}. In contrast, nucleolar proteomic responses to {IR} are both temporally and spatially distinct from those caused by {UV}, and more limited in terms of magnitude. With the exception of the {NHEJ} and paraspeckle proteins, where {IR} induces rapid and transient changes within 15 min of the damage, {IR} does not alter the ratios of most other functional nucleolar protein complexes. The rapid transient decrease of {NHEJ} proteins in the nucleolus indicates that it may reflect a response to {DNA} damage. Our results underline that the nucleolus is a specific stress response organelle that responds to different damage and stress agents in a unique, damage-specific manner.},

	abstract = {The association between large tumor size and metastatic risk in a majority of clinical cancers has led to questions as to whether these observations are causally related or whether one is simply a marker for the other. This is partly due to an uncertainty about how metastasis-promoting gene expression changes can arise in primary tumors. We investigated this question through the analysis of a previously defined "lung metastasis gene-expression signature" ({LMS}) that mediates experimental breast cancer metastasis selectively to the lung and is expressed by primary human breast cancer with a high risk for developing lung metastasis. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the {LMS} promotes primary tumor growth that enriches for {LMS}(+) cells, and it allows for intravasation after reaching a critical tumor size. Clinically, this corresponds to {LMS}(+) tumors being larger at diagnosis compared with {LMS}(-) tumors and to a marked rise in the incidence of metastasis after {LMS}(+) tumors reach 2 cm. Patients with {LMS}-expressing primary tumors selectively fail in the lung compared with the bone or other visceral sites and have a worse overall survival. The mechanistic linkage between metastasis gene expression, accelerated tumor growth, and likelihood of metastatic recurrence provided by the {LMS} may help to explain observations of prognostic gene signatures in primary cancer and how tumor growth can both lead to metastasis and be a marker for cells destined to metastasize.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Ovarian cancer causes more than 15000 deaths per year in the United States. The survival of patients is quite heterogeneous, and accurate prognostic tools would help with the clinical management of these patients.
{METHODS}: We developed and validated two gene expression signatures, the first for predicting survival in advanced-stage, serous ovarian cancer and the second for predicting debulking status. We integrated 13 publicly available datasets totaling 1525 subjects. We trained prediction models using a meta-analysis variation on the compound covariable method, tested models by a "leave-one-dataset-out" procedure, and validated models in additional independent datasets. Selected genes from the debulking signature were validated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ({qRT}-{PCR}) in two further independent cohorts of 179 and 78 patients, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: The survival signature stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups (hazard ratio = 2.19; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.84 to 2.61) statistically significantly better than the {TCGA} signature (P = .04). {POSTN}, {CXCL}14, {FAP}, {NUAK}1, {PTCH}1, and {TGFBR}2 were validated by {qRT}-{PCR} (P {\textless} .05) and {POSTN}, {CXCL}14, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 were validated by immunohistochemistry (P {\textless} .001) as independent predictors of debulking status. The sum of immunohistochemistry intensities for these three proteins provided a tool that classified 92.8\% of samples correctly in high- and low-risk groups for suboptimal debulking (area under the curve = 0.89; 95\% {CI} = 0.84 to 0.93).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our survival signature provides the most accurate and validated prognostic model for early- and advanced-stage high-grade, serous ovarian cancer. The debulking signature accurately predicts the outcome of cytoreductive surgery, potentially allowing for stratification of patients for primary vs secondary cytoreduction.},

Eighteen significantly mutated genes were identified, including five genes ({RUNX}1, {CBFB}, {MYH}9, {MLL}3 and {SF}3B1) previously linked to haematopoietic disorders. Mutant {MAP}3K1 was associated with luminal A status, low-grade histology and low proliferation rates, whereas mutant {TP}53 was associated with the opposite pattern. Moreover, mutant {GATA}3 correlated with suppression of proliferation upon aromatase inhibitor treatment. Pathway analysis demonstrated that mutations in {MAP}2K4, a {MAP}3K1 substrate, produced similar perturbations as {MAP}3K1 loss. Distinct phenotypes in oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer are associated with specific patterns of somatic mutations that map into cellular pathways linked to tumour biology, but most recurrent mutations are relatively infrequent. Prospective clinical trials based on these findings will require comprehensive genome sequencing.},

Of 309 human {miRNAs} assayed, we identify 133 {miRNAs} expressed in human breast and breast tumors. We used {mRNA} expression profiling to classify the breast tumors as luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, {HER}2+ and normal-like. A number of {miRNAs} are differentially expressed between these molecular tumor subtypes and individual {miRNAs} are associated with clinicopathological factors. Furthermore, we find that {miRNAs} could classify basal versus luminal tumor subtypes in an independent data set. In some cases, changes in {miRNA} expression correlate with genomic loss or gain; in others, changes in {miRNA} expression are likely due to changes in primary transcription and or {miRNA} biogenesis. Finally, the expression of {DICER}1 and {AGO}2 is correlated with tumor subtype and may explain some of the changes in {miRNA} expression observed.This study represents the first integrated analysis of {miRNA} expression, {mRNA} expression and genomic changes in human breast cancer and may serve as a basis for functional studies of the role of {miRNAs} in the etiology of breast cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bead-based flow cytometric {miRNA} expression profiling might be a suitable platform to classify breast cancer into prognostic molecular subtypes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Inferring cluster structure in microarray datasets is a fundamental task for the so-called -omic sciences. It is also a fundamental question in Statistics, Data Analysis and Classification, in particular with regard to the prediction of the number of clusters in a dataset, usually established via internal validation measures. Despite the wealth of internal measures available in the literature, new ones have been recently proposed, some of them specifically for microarray data.
{RESULTS}: We consider five such measures: Clest, Consensus (Consensus Clustering), {FOM} (Figure of Merit), Gap (Gap Statistics) and {ME} (Model Explorer), in addition to the classic {WCSS} (Within Cluster Sum-of-Squares) and {KL} (Krzanowski and Lai index). We perform extensive experiments on six benchmark microarray datasets, using both Hierarchical and K-means clustering algorithms, and we provide an analysis assessing both the intrinsic ability of a measure to predict the correct number of clusters in a dataset and its merit relative to the other measures. We pay particular attention both to precision and speed. Moreover, we also provide various fast approximation algorithms for the computation of Gap, {FOM} and {WCSS}. The main result is a hierarchy of those measures in terms of precision and speed, highlighting some of their merits and limitations not reported before in the literature.
{CONCLUSION}: Based on our analysis, we draw several conclusions for the use of those internal measures on microarray data. We report the main ones. Consensus is by far the best performer in terms of predictive power and remarkably algorithm-independent. Unfortunately, on large datasets, it may be of no use because of its non-trivial computer time demand (weeks on a state of the art {PC}). {FOM} is the second best performer although, quite surprisingly, it may not be competitive in this scenario: it has essentially the same predictive power of {WCSS} but it is from 6 to 100 times slower in time, depending on the dataset. The approximation algorithms for the computation of {FOM}, Gap and {WCSS} perform very well, i.e., they are faster while still granting a very close approximation of {FOM} and {WCSS}. The approximation algorithm for the computation of Gap deserves to be singled-out since it has a predictive power far better than Gap, it is competitive with the other measures, but it is at least two order of magnitude faster in time with respect to Gap. Another important novel conclusion that can be drawn from our analysis is that all the measures we have considered show severe limitations on large datasets, either due to computational demand (Consensus, as already mentioned, Clest and Gap) or to lack of precision (all of the other measures, including their approximations). The software and datasets are available under the {GNU} {GPL} on the supplementary material web page.},

	abstract = {Genetic instability, provoked by exogenous mutagens, is well linked to initiation of cancer. However, even in unstressed cells, {DNA} undergoes a plethora of spontaneous alterations provoked by its inherent chemical instability and the intracellular milieu. Base excision repair ({BER}) is the major cellular pathway responsible for repair of these lesions, and as deficiency in {BER} activity results in {DNA} damage it has been proposed that it may trigger the development of sporadic cancers. Nevertheless, experimental evidence for this model remains inconsistent and elusive. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of {BER} deficient human cells using stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture ({SILAC}), and demonstrate that {BER} deficiency, which induces genetic instability, results in dramatic changes in gene expression, resembling changes found in many cancers. We observed profound alterations in tissue homeostasis, serine biosynthesis, and one-carbon- and amino acid metabolism, all of which have been identified as cancer cell 'hallmarks'. For the first time, this study describes gene expression changes characteristic for cells deficient in repair of endogenous {DNA} lesions by {BER}. These expression changes resemble those observed in cancer cells, suggesting that genetically unstable {BER} deficient cells may be a source of pre-cancerous cells.},

	abstract = {{MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression. These small, non-coding {RNAs} are believed to regulate more than a third of all protein coding genes, and they have been implicated in the control of virtually all biological processes, including the biology of stem cells. The essential roles of {miRNAs} in the control of pluripotent stem cells were clearly established by the finding that embryonic stem ({ES}) cells lacking proteins required for {miRNA} biogenesis exhibit defects in proliferation and differentiation. Subsequently, the function of numerous {miRNAs} has been shown to control the fate of {ES} cells and to directly influence critical gene regulatory networks controlled by pluripotency factors Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog. Moreover, a growing list of tissue-specific {miRNAs}, which are silenced or not processed fully in {ES} cells, has been found to promote differentiation upon their expression and proper processing. The importance of {miRNAs} for {ES} cells is further indicated by the exciting discovery that specific {miRNA} mimics or {miRNA} inhibitors promote the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cells. Although some progress has been made during the past two years in our understanding of the contribution of specific {miRNAs} during reprogramming, further progress is needed since it is highly likely that {miRNAs} play even wider roles in the generation of {iPS} cells than currently appreciated. This review examines recent developments related to the roles of {miRNAs} in the biology of pluripotent stem cells. In addition, we posit that more than a dozen additional {miRNAs} are excellent candidates for influencing the generation of {iPS} cells as well as for providing new insights into the process of reprogramming.},

However, samples collected from human subjects in clinical trials possess a level of complexity, arising from multiple cell types, that can obfuscate the analysis of data derived from them. Failure to identify, quantify, and incorporate sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on subsequent statistical studies. We describe an approach that builds upon a linear latent variable model, in which expression levels from mixed cell populations are modeled as the weighted average of expression from different cell types. We solve these equations using quadratic programming, which efficiently identifies the globally optimal solution while preserving non-negativity of the fraction of the cells. We applied our method to various existing platforms to estimate proportions of different pure cell or tissue types and gene expression profilings of distinct phenotypes, with a focus on complex samples collected in clinical trials. We tested our methods on several well controlled benchmark data sets with known mixing fractions of pure cell or tissue types and {mRNA} expression profiling data from samples collected in a clinical trial. Accurate agreement between predicted and actual mixing fractions was observed. In addition, our method was able to predict mixing fractions for more than ten species of circulating cells and to provide accurate estimates for relatively rare cell types ({\textless}10\% total population). Furthermore, accurate changes in leukocyte trafficking associated with Fingolomid ({FTY}720) treatment were identified that were consistent with previous results generated by both cell counts and flow cytometry. These data suggest that our method can solve one of the open questions regarding the analysis of complex transcriptional data: namely, how to identify the optimal mixing fractions in a given experiment.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}

In high-throughput genomic and proteomic experiments, investigators monitor expression across a set of experimental conditions. To gain an understanding of broader biological phenomena, researchers have until recently been limited to post hoc analyses of significant gene lists.Method: We describe a general framework, significance analysis of function and expression ({SAFE}), for conducting valid tests of gene categories ab initio. {SAFE} is a two-stage, permutation-based method that can be applied to various experimental designs, accounts for the unknown correlation among genes and enables permutation-based estimation of error rates.


{RESULTS}

The utility and flexibility of {SAFE} is illustrated with a microarray dataset of human lung carcinomas and gene categories based on Gene Ontology and the Protein Family database. Significant gene categories were observed in comparisons of (1) tumor versus normal tissue, (2) multiple tumor subtypes and (3) survival times.


{AVAILABILITY}

Code to implement {SAFE} in the statistical package R is available from the authors.

Finding the canonical correlations between these datasets requires the inversion of their corresponding sample correlation matrices. When the number of variables is large compared to the number of experimental units it is impossible to calculate the inverse of these matrices directly and therefore it is necessary to add a multiple of the identity matrix to them. This procedure is known as regularization. In this paper we present an alternative method to the existing regularization algorithm. The proposed method is based on the estimates of the correlation matrices which minimize the mean squared error risk function. The solution of this optimization problem can be found analytically and consists of a small set of computationally inexpensive equations. We also present material which shows that the proposed method is more stable and provides more accurate results than the standard regularized canonical correlation method. Finally, the application of our original method to {NCI}-60 {microRNA} cancer data proves that it can deliver useful insights in study cases which involve hundreds of variables.},

We sought to evaluate the impact of {RAS} and {PIK}3CA mutations on cumulative incidence of metastasis to potentially curable sites of liver and lung and other sites such as bone and brain.
{METHODS}: We performed a computerized search of the electronic medical record of our institution for {mCRC} cases genotyped for {RAS} or {PIK}3CA mutations from 2008 to 2012. Cases were reviewed for patient characteristics, survival, and site-specific metastasis.
{RESULTS}: Among the 918 patients identified, 477 cases were {RAS} wild type, and 441 cases had a {RAS} mutation (394 at {KRAS} exon 2, 29 at {KRAS} exon 3 or 4, and 18 in {NRAS}). {RAS} mutation was significantly associated with shorter median overall survival ({OS}) and on multivariate analysis independently predicted worse {OS} ({HR}, 1.6; P {\textless} .01). {RAS} mutant {mCRC} exhibited a significantly higher cumulative incidence of lung, bone, and brain metastasis and on multivariate analysis was an independent predictor of involvement of these sites ({HR}, 1.5, 1.6, and 3.7, respectively). {PIK}3CA mutations occurred in 10\% of the 786 cases genotyped, did not predict for worse survival, and did not exhibit a site-specific pattern of metastatic spread.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The metastatic potential of {CRC} varies with the presence of {RAS} mutation. {RAS} mutation is associated with worse {OS} and increased incidence of lung, bone, and brain metastasis. An understanding of this site-specific pattern of spread may help to inform physicians' assessment of symptoms in patients with {mCRC}. Cancer 2014. © 2014 American Cancer Society.},

We aimed to longitudinally evaluate morphology and size of organoids in 3D co-cultures of normal ({MCF}10A) or pre-malignant ({MCF}10DCIS.com) {MEC} and {hTERT}-immortalized fibroblasts from reduction mammoplasty ({RMF}). This co-culture model, based on an isogenic panel of cell lines, can yield insights to understand breast cancer progression. However, 3D cultures pose challenges for quantitative assessment and imaging, especially when the goal is to measure the same organoid structures over time. Using optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) as a non-invasive method to longitudinally quantify morphological changes, we found that {OCT} provides excellent visualization of {MEC}-fibroblast co-cultures as they form ductal acini and remodel over time. Different concentrations of fibroblasts and {MEC} reflecting reported physiological ratios [1] were evaluated, and we found that larger, hollower, and more aspherical acini were formed only by pre-malignant {MEC} ({MCF}10DCIS.com) in the presence of fibroblasts, whereas in comparable conditions, normal {MEC} ({MCF}10A) acini remained smaller and less aspherical. The ratio of fibroblast to {MEC} was also influential in determining organoid phenotypes, with higher concentrations of fibroblasts producing more aspherical structures in {MCF}10DCIS.com. These findings suggest that stromal-epithelial interactions between fibroblasts and {MEC} can be modeled in vitro, with {OCT} imaging as a convenient means of assaying time dependent changes, with the potential for yielding important biological insights about the differences between benign and pre-malignant cells.},

As a {DNA} cross-linking agent, cisplatin may be effective treatment for hereditary {BRCA}1-mutated breast cancers. Because sporadic triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}) and {BRCA}1-associated breast cancer share features suggesting common pathogenesis, we conducted a neoadjuvant trial of cisplatin in {TNBC} and explored specific biomarkers to identify predictors of response. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS} Twenty-eight women with stage {II} or {III} breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors and {HER}2/Neu ({TNBC}) were enrolled and treated with four cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m(2) every 21 days. After definitive surgery, patients received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy per their treating physicians. Clinical and pathologic treatment response were assessed, and pretreatment tumor samples were evaluated for selected biomarkers. Results Six (22\%) of 28 patients achieved pathologic complete responses, including both patients with {BRCA}1 germline mutations;18 (64\%) patients had a clinical complete or partial response. Fourteen (50\%) patients showed good pathologic responses (Miller-Payne score of 3, 4, or 5), 10 had minor responses (Miller-Payne score of 1 or 2), and four (14\%) progressed. All {TNBCs} clustered with reference basal-like tumors by hierarchical clustering. Factors associated with good cisplatin response include young age (P = .001), low {BRCA}1 {mRNA} expression (P = .03), {BRCA}1 promoter methylation (P = .04), p53 nonsense or frameshift mutations (P = .01), and a gene expression signature of E2F3 activation (P = .03). {CONCLUSION} Single-agent cisplatin induced response in a subset of patients with {TNBC}. Decreased {BRCA}1 expression may identify subsets of {TNBCs} that are cisplatin sensitive. Other biomarkers show promise in predicting cisplatin response.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Most tumor tissue is composed of parenchymal tumor cells and tumor stroma. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) can function as precursors for tumor stromal cells, including myofibroblasts, which provide a favorable environment for tumor progression. A close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a tumor microenvironment has been described. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are enriched with a discrete set of cellular proteins, and are therefore expected to exert diverse biological functions according to cell origin.
{METHODS}: In the current study, we determined the biological effect of exosomes from two ovarian cancer cell lines ({SK}-{OV}-3 and {OVCAR}-3) on adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}).
{RESULTS}: Exosome treatment induced {ADSCs} to exhibit the typical characteristics of tumor-associated myofibroblasts, with increased expression of α-{SMA}, and also increased expression of tumor-promoting factors ({SDF}-1 and {TGF}-β). This phenomenon was correlated with an increased expression of {TGF}-β receptors I and {II}. Analysis of {TGF}-β receptor-mediated downstream signaling pathways revealed that each exosome activated different signaling pathways, showing that exosomes from {SK}-{OV}-3 cells increased the phosphorylated form of {SMAD}2, which is essential in the {SMAD}-dependent pathway, whereas exosomes from {OVCAR}-3 cells increased the phosphorylated form of {AKT}, a representative {SMAD}-independent pathway. Taken together, exosomes from ovarian cancer cells induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} by activating an intracellular signaling pathway, although the activated pathway could differ from exosome-to-exosome.
{CONCLUSION}: The current study suggested that ovarian cancer-derived exosomes contribute to the generation of tumor-associated myofibroblasts from {MSCs} in tumor stroma.},

For hematopoietic malignancies, a classification scheme based on the phenotypic similarity between tumor cells and normal cells has been successfully used to define tumor subtypes; however, use of normal cell types as a reference by which to classify solid tumors has not been widely emulated, in part due to more limited understanding of epithelial cell differentiation compared with hematopoiesis. To provide a better definition of the subtypes of epithelial cells comprising the breast epithelium, we performed a systematic analysis of a large set of breast epithelial markers in more than 15,000 normal breast cells, which identified 11 differentiation states for normal luminal cells. We then applied information from this analysis to classify human breast tumors based on normal cell types into 4 major subtypes, {HR}0-{HR}3, which were differentiated by vitamin D, androgen, and estrogen hormone receptor ({HR}) expression. Examination of 3,157 human breast tumors revealed that these {HR} subtypes were distinct from the current classification scheme, which is based on estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Patient outcomes were best when tumors expressed all 3 hormone receptors (subtype {HR}3) and worst when they expressed none of the receptors (subtype {HR}0). Together, these data provide an ontological classification scheme associated with patient survival differences and provides actionable insights for treating breast tumors.},

	abstract = {The premise that all tumors are targetable has been met with some controversy in the approach to epithelial ovarian cancer ({EOC}). Genomic analysis shows that these tumors (specifically, high-grade serous carcinomas) are genomically unstable and lack actionable driver mutations, much like {HER}2 in breast and gastric cancers. In this paper, Michael Birrer, {MD}, {PhD}, Massachusetts General Hospital, argues that the interpretation of genomic data in ovarian cancer requires a more thoughtful approach that necessitates a closer inspection of the data beyond the mere presence or absence of mutations. We must look at the extensive genomic alterations in {DNA} and, to understand more about the role of those genes affected by these changes, look beyond the tumor to the role of the stroma. As such, Dr. Birrer is arguing for the importance of translational research. This will be the key to precision medicine in ovarian cancer, as we approach drug discovery and improvements in treatment. Dr. Birrer is a world-renowned scientist who has devoted his career to the study of gynecologic cancers. He has published over 200 papers and written over 27 book chapters and reviews, served on numerous leadership positions in gynecologic oncology (including as co-chair of the National Cancer Institute's Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee), and remains a clinician-scientist with an active lab and an active clinic. His career trajectory has shown me it is possible to be engaged as a researcher and a clinician and the work he has done has already impacted the care of patients with ovarian cancer. Don S.

However, the expression profiles of the actual constituent populations are often perturbed from those of the reference profiles due to gene expression changes in cells associated with microenvironmental or developmental effects. Existing deconvolution algorithms do not account for these changes and give incorrect results when benchmarked against those measured by well-established flow cytometry, even after batch correction was applied. We introduce {PERT}, a new probabilistic expression deconvolution method that detects and accounts for a shared, multiplicative perturbation in the reference profiles when performing expression deconvolution. We applied {PERT} and three other state-of-the-art expression deconvolution methods to predict cell frequencies within heterogeneous human blood samples that were collected under several conditions (uncultured mono-nucleated and lineage-depleted cells, and culture-derived lineage-depleted cells). Only {PERT}'s predicted proportions of the constituent populations matched those assigned by flow cytometry. Genes associated with cell cycle processes were highly enriched among those with the largest predicted expression changes between the cultured and uncultured conditions. We anticipate that {PERT} will be widely applicable to expression deconvolution strategies that use profiles from reference populations that vary from the corresponding constituent populations in cellular state but not cellular phenotypic identity.},

To test the hypothesis that lactogens regulate expression of neuropeptides that control appetite, we used the prolactin ({PRL})-responsive rat insulinoma ({INS}-1) cell line as an experimental paradigm. {INS}-1 cells express {mRNA} for neuropeptide Y ({NPY}) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript ({CART}) but little or no agouti-related peptide or proopiomelanocortin. As in the hypothalamus in vivo, the levels of {NPY} {mRNA} in {INS}-1 cells were increased by glucose deprivation. Conversely, high media glucose concentrations (11 mm) reduced the levels of {NPY} {mRNA} and increased levels of {CART} {mRNA}. Rat {PRL} stimulated a 4- to 7-fold increase in {NPY} {mRNA} in {INS}-1 cells (P {\textless} 0.001) and reduced by 50-80\% the levels of {CART} {mRNA} (P {\textless} 0.001). The effects of {PRL} on {NPY} {mRNA} were time and dose dependent and potentiated by glucose deprivation or exogenous dexamethasone (Dex). Hormonal induction of {NPY} {mRNA} was accompanied by increased secretion of {NPY} peptide into cellular conditioned media. {PRL} stimulated a 1.8- to 3.5-fold increase in expression of {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}), which mediates in part the effects of hypoglycemia on {NPY} expression in the hypothalamus in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of {AMPK} activity blunted slightly the effects of {PRL} on {NPY} and {CART} but reversed entirely the effects of Dex or of {PRL} plus Dex on {CART} {mRNA}. The effects of {PRL} on {NPY}, {CART}, and {AMPK} {mRNA} were mirrored by those of other lactogens and somatogens including placental lactogen and {GH}. Rat {PRL} and rat {GH} in combination had no additive or synergistic effects, suggesting that lactogenic and somatogenic hormones regulate neuropeptide gene expression through similar mechanisms. We conclude that lactogens act in concert with glucose deprivation and glucocorticoids to induce {NPY} expression and inhibit {CART}. We speculate that the lactogens facilitate food intake in response to fasting or nutrient deprivation, when glucose levels decline and cortisol levels rise.},

It is also becoming apparent that molecules which sense, or control, the energetic status of the cell play a key role in the regulation of muscle mass [e.g. {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 α ({PGC}1α)].

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 114 patients with stage I-{IV} {CRC} who underwent primary tumor resection. Quantitative real-time {PCR} and immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) assays were performed in samples obtained from the primary tumors. The correlation between the expression of these markers and the expression of p53, Bcl-2, Ki67, epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) and vascular endothelial growth factor was assessed with the Spearman coefficient (r). Results: The {ITGAV} gene was found to be significantly amplified in tumors with positive perineural invasion (p = 0.028).

Conclusions: {ECM} gene expression did not correlate with classical prognostic factors for {CRC}, but overexpression of the {ITGAV} gene and protein was correlated with an increased risk of perineural invasion.

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in {\textasciitilde}40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by {CNAs}, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in {PPP}2R2A, {MTAP} and {MAP}2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired {DNA}–{RNA} profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘{CNA}-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic {CNAs} on the transcriptome.},

We collated a large number of published expression studies on mouse haemopoietic cell lineages comprising 304 cell samples from 29 independent experiments performed on a single microarray platform (Affymetrix {MOE}430-2). The data were subjected to network-based cluster analysis using Biolayout Express(3D). Genes with related function clustered together in distinct regions of the graph reaffirming many known associations between gene expression and role in specific pathways and defining most major cell types of the immune system. Promoters of genes within individual clusters were distinguished by over-representation of regulatory motifs recognised by specific transcription factors. However, these data indicate that commonly used myeloid subpopulation markers, such as {CD}11c (Itgax), do not correlate with expression of other genes, and further bring into question their use in defining myeloid cell lineage, activation (M1 vs. M2) and antigen-presenting cell function. In particular, there were few {mRNA} markers that clearly distinguished classical dendritic cells ({DC}) from macrophages, other than low expression of genes required for phagocytic activity. Bone marrow-derived {DC}, grown in {GM}-{CSF}, were clearly identified as phagocytes and distinguished from isolated lymphoid tissue {DC}. Thus, through pooling datasets from public data and examining the gene expression clusters within, we can learn a great deal about the transcriptional networks that underpin the differences in functional activities between cell populations of the immune system.},

	abstract = {Communication between irradiated and un-irradiated (bystander) cells can cause damage in cells that are not directly targeted by ionizing radiation, a process known as the bystander effect. Bystander effects can also lead to chromosomal/genomic instability within the progeny of bystander cells, similar to the progeny of directly irradiated cells. The factors that mediate this cellular communication can be transferred between cells via gap junctions or released into the extracellular media following irradiation, but their nature has not been fully characterized. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the bystander effect mediator contains an {RNA} molecule that may be carried by exosomes. {MCF}7 cells were irradiated with 2 Gy of X rays and the extracellular media was harvested. {RNase} treatment abrogated the ability of the media to induce early and late chromosomal damage in bystander cells. Furthermore, treatment of bystander cells with exosomes isolated from this media increased the levels of genomic damage. These results suggest that the bystander effect, and genomic instability, are at least in part mediated by exosomes and implicate a role for {RNA}.},

	volume = {2},
	issn = {1177-9314},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Exosomes, a type of membrane vesicles, released from tumor cells have been shown to be capable of transferring tumor antigens to dendritic cells and activating specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Recent work has demonstrated the presence of high numbers of exosomes in malignant effusions. Umbilical cord blood ({UCB}) is a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells and from which a significant number of dendritic cells can be produced. We hypothesized that the exosomes released from metastatic ovarian carcinoma were able to present tumor specific antigen to dendritic cells derived from unrelated umbilical cord blood, then could stimulate resting T cells to differentiate and induce effective cytotoxicity.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation of malignant ascites from ovarian cancer patients (n = 10). Purified exosomes were further characterized by Western blot analyses and immunoelectronic microscopy. Dendritic cells were collected from unrelated umbilical cord blood and cultured in the presence of {GM}-{CSF}, {IL}-4 and {TNF}-α. Resting T cells were mixed with dentritic cells previously primed with exosomes and the cytotoxicity were measured by {MTT} method. T cells were activated by {DCs} presented with exosomes.
{RESULTS}: 1) the exosomes isolated from the ascites were membrane vesicles of about 30-90nm in diameter; 2) the exosomes expressed {MHC} class I molecules, {HSP}70, {HSP}90, Her2/Neu, and Mart1; and 3)umbilical cord blood-derived {DCs} previously exosome-primed stimulated resting T cells to differentiate and produce effective cytotoxicity.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results suggested that tumor-specific antigens present on exosomes can be presented by {DCs} derived from unrelated umbilical cord blood to induce tumor specific cytotoxicity and this may represent as a novel immunotherapy for ovarian cancer.},

Exosomes was stable at 4℃ 24h for shipping before stored at -80℃ and was stable in urine when stored at -80°C for 12months. Exosomal {miRNA} was detectable despite 5 repeat freeze-thaw cycles. The detection of {miRNA} by quantitative {PCR} showed high reproducibility ({\textgreater}94\% for intra-assay and {\textgreater}76\% for inter-assay), high sensitivity (positive call 100\% for {CKD} patients), broad dynamic range (8-log wide) and good linearity for quantification (R(2){\textgreater}0.99). {miR}-29c and {miR}-200c showed different expression in different types of kidney disease. In summary, the presence of urinary exosomal {miRNA} was confirmed for patients with a diversity of chronic kidney disease.

Recent studies suggest the existence of distinct {PI}3K-{III} sub-complexes that can potentially confer functional specificity. While a substantial body of work has focused on the roles of individual {PI}3K-{III} subunits in autophagy, functional studies on their contribution to endocytic receptor downregulation and cytokinesis are limited. We therefore sought to elucidate the specific nature of the {PI}3K-{III} complexes involved in these two processes. High-content microscopy-based assays combined with {siRNA}-mediated depletion of individual subunits indicated that a specific sub-complex containing {VPS}15, {VPS}34, Beclin 1, {UVRAG} and {BIF}-1 regulates both receptor degradation and cytokinesis, whereas {ATG}14L, a {PI}3K-{III} subunit involved in autophagy, is not required. The unanticipated role of {UVRAG} and {BIF}-1 in cytokinesis was supported by a strong localisation of these proteins to the midbody. Importantly, while the tumour suppressive functions of Beclin 1, {UVRAG} and {BIF}-1 have previously been ascribed to their roles in autophagy, these results open the possibility that they may also contribute to tumour suppression via downregulation of mitogenic signalling by growth factor receptors or preclusion of aneuploidy by ensuring faithful completion of cell division.},

Independent Component Analysis ({ICA}) is one of a few number of unsupervised algorithms that have been applied to microarray gene expression data in an attempt to understand phenotype differences in terms of changes in the activation/inhibition patterns of biological pathways. While the {ICA} model has been shown to outperform other linear representations of the data such as Principal Components Analysis ({PCA}), a validation using explicit pathway and regulatory element information has not yet been performed. We apply a range of popular {ICA} algorithms to six of the largest microarray cancer datasets and use pathway-knowledge and regulatory-element databases for validation. We show that {ICA} outperforms {PCA} and clustering-based methods in that {ICA} components map closer to known cancer-related pathways, regulatory modules, and cancer phenotypes. Furthermore, we identify cancer signalling and oncogenic pathways and regulatory modules that play a prominent role in breast cancer and relate the differential activation patterns of these to breast cancer phenotypes. Importantly, we find novel associations linking immune response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways with estrogen receptor status and histological grade, respectively. In addition, we find associations linking the activity levels of biological pathways and transcription factors ({NF}1 and {NFAT}) with clinical outcome in breast cancer. {ICA} provides a framework for a more biologically relevant interpretation of genomewide transcriptomic data. Adopting {ICA} as the analysis tool of choice will help understand the phenotype-pathway relationship and thus help elucidate the molecular taxonomy of heterogeneous cancers and of other complex genetic diseases.},

To further understand the mechanisms underlying {PALB}2-mediated {DNA} repair and tumor suppression functions, we targeted Palb2 in the mouse. Palb2-deficient murine {ES} cells recapitulated {DNA} damage defects caused by {PALB}2 depletion in human cells, and germ-line deletion of Palb2 led to early embryonic lethality. Somatic deletion of Palb2 driven by K14-Cre led to mammary tumor formation with long latency. Codeletion of both Palb2 and Tumor protein 53 (Trp53) accelerated mammary tumor formation. Like {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 mutant breast cancers, these tumors were defective in {RAD}51 focus formation, reflecting a defect in Palb2 {HR}-{DSBR} function, a strongly suspected contributor to Brca1, Brca2, and Palb2 mammary tumor development. However, unlike the case of Brca1-mutant cells, Trp53bp1 deletion failed to rescue the genomic instability of Palb2- or Brca2-mutant primary lymphocytes. Therefore, Palb2-driven {DNA} damage control is, in part, distinct from that executed by Brca1 and more similar to that of Brca2. The mechanisms underlying Palb2 mammary tumor suppression functions can now be explored genetically in vivo.},

Because {BRCA}1 tumors frequently display a basal-like phenotype, this study was designed to determine whether {TP}53 mutations are correlated with the hereditary {BRCA}1 mutated status or the particular phenotype of these tumors. The {TP}53 gene status was first investigated in a series of 35 {BRCA}1 {BLCs} using immunohistochemistry, direct sequencing of the coding sequence, and functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast, and compared with the {TP}53 status in a series of 38 sporadic (nonhereditary) {BLCs}. Using this sensitive approach, {TP}53 was found to be frequently mutated in both {BRCA}1 (34 of 35, 97\%) and sporadic (35 of 38, 92\%) {BLCs}. However, the spectrum of mutation was different, particularly with a higher rate of complex mutations, such as insertion/deletion, in {BRCA}1 {BLCs} than in the sporadic group [14 of 33 (42\%) and 3 of 34 (9\%), [corrected] respectively; P = 0.002]. Secondly, the incidence of {TP}53 mutations was analyzed in 19 {BRCA}1 luminal tumors using the same strategy. Interestingly, only 10 of these 19 tumors were mutated (53\%), a frequency similar to that found in grade-matched sporadic luminal tumors. In conclusion, {TP}53 mutation is highly recurrent in {BLCs} independently of {BRCA}1 status, but not a common feature of {BRCA}1 luminal tumors.},

	abstract = {Background
Transposable elements ({TEs}) encode sequences necessary for their own transposition, including signals required for the termination of transcription. {TE} sequences within the introns of human genes show an antisense orientation bias, which has been proposed to reflect selection against {TE} sequences in the sense orientation owing to their ability to terminate the transcription of host gene transcripts. While there is evidence in support of this model for some elements, the extent to which {TE} sequences actually terminate transcription of human gene across the genome remains an open question.

Results
Using high-throughput sequencing data, we have characterized over 9,000 distinct {TE}-derived sequences that provide transcription termination sites for 5,747 human genes across eight different cell types. Rarefaction curve analysis suggests that there may be twice as many {TE}-derived termination sites ({TE}-{TTS}) genome-wide among all human cell types. The local chromatin environment for these {TE}-{TTS} is similar to that seen for 3′ {UTR} canonical {TTS} and distinct from the chromatin environment of other intragenic {TE} sequences. However, those {TE}-{TTS} located within the introns of human genes were found to be far more cell type-specific than the canonical {TTS}. {TE}-{TTS} were much more likely to be found in the sense orientation than other intragenic {TE} sequences of the same {TE} family and {TE}-{TTS} in the sense orientation terminate transcription more efficiently than those found in the antisense orientation. Alu sequences were found to provide a large number of relatively weak {TTS}, whereas {LTR} elements provided a smaller number of much stronger {TTS}.

Conclusions
{TE} sequences provide numerous termination sites to human genes, and {TE}-derived {TTS} are particularly cell type-specific. Thus, {TE} sequences provide a powerful mechanism for the diversification of transcriptional profiles between cell types and among evolutionary lineages, since most {TE}-{TTS} are evolutionarily young. The extent of transcription termination by {TEs} seen here, along with the preference for sense-oriented {TE} insertions to provide {TTS}, is consistent with the observed antisense orientation bias of human {TEs}.},

Afferent signals continuously inform the central nervous system about changes in energy homeostasis. The brain interprets and integrates these signals and responds with efferent signals that help maintain a constant energy balance. Neuropeptides that originate from the hypothalamus regulate food intake either by stimulating (orexigenic factors) or inhibiting (anorexigenic factors) appetite. Studies using brain or peripheral peptide injections have shown that neuropeptide Y ({NPY}) and orexins are potent orexigenic factors in fish, whereas cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript ({CART}) peptides decrease food intake. Complex interactions exist between these central neuropeptide systems. For example, {NPY} and orexins have synergistic effects on food intake and they are both modulated by {CART} peptides. These systems are also influenced by endocrine factors from the periphery, including hormones from the gut, such as cholecystokinin ({CCK}), the pancreatic hormone amylin and the adipocyte hormone leptin. Fasting or ingestion of a meal induces changes in the {mRNA} expression of {NPY}, orexins and {CART}, suggesting that nutritional status modulates the action of these systems. This brief review will focus on our current knowledge on the structure and role of these six appetite-regulating peptides in fish.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

The risk of local and regional relapse associated with each breast cancer molecular subtype was determined in a large cohort of patients with breast cancer. Subtype assignment was accomplished using a validated six-marker immunohistochemical panel applied to tissue microarrays.


{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}

Semiquantitative analysis of estrogen receptor ({ER}), progesterone receptor ({PR}), Ki-67, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2), epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}), and cytokeratin ({CK}) 5/6 was performed on tissue microarrays constructed from 2,985 patients with early invasive breast cancer. Patients were classified into the following categories: luminal A, luminal B, luminal-{HER}2, {HER}2 enriched, basal-like, or triple-negative phenotype-nonbasal. Multivariable Cox analysis was used to determine the risk of local or regional relapse associated the intrinsic subtypes, adjusting for standard clinicopathologic factors.


{RESULTS}

The intrinsic molecular subtype was successfully determined in 2,985 tumors. The median follow-up time was 12 years, and there have been a total of 325 local recurrences and 227 regional lymph node recurrences. Luminal A tumors ({ER} or {PR} positive, {HER}2 negative, Ki-67 {\textless} 1\%) had the best prognosis and the lowest rate of local or regional relapse. For patients undergoing breast conservation, {HER}2-enriched and basal subtypes demonstrated an increased risk of regional recurrence, and this was statistically significant on multivariable analysis. After mastectomy, luminal B, luminal-{HER}2, {HER}2-enriched, and basal subtypes were all associated with an increased risk of local and regional relapse on multivariable analysis.


{CONCLUSION}

Luminal A tumors are associated with a low risk of local or regional recurrence. Molecular subtyping of breast tumors using a six-marker immunohistochemical panel can identify patients at increased risk of local and regional recurrence.},

Reformulating this multilinear {HOSVD} such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this {HOSVD} with an integration of genome-scale {mRNA} expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione.

The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression.

Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript ({CART}) codes for a peptide widely distributed in nervous and endocrine tissues. {CART} immunoreactivity ({CART}-{LI}) has been detected in human insulinomas.


{OBJECTIVE}

The objective of the study was to investigate the measurement of plasma {CART}-{LI} as a tumor marker of neuroendocrine malignancy.


{DESIGN} {AND} {SUBJECTS}

Plasma {CART}-{LI} levels were measured in 401 patients with a range of diagnoses: neuroendocrine malignancy (n = 131), after removal of neuroendocrine malignancy (n = 27), without any form of tumor or renal impairment (n = 192), with renal impairment (n = 17) and with nonneuroendocrine tumors (n = 34). Chromatography methods were used to investigate {CART}-{LI} circulating in human plasma.


{RESULTS}

The upper limit of normal calculated for {CART}-{LI} was 150 pmol/liter. Mean circulating plasma {CART}-{LI} among neuroendocrine tumor patients was 440 pmol/liter, 56\% of subjects having levels greater than 150 pmol/liter. Measuring {CART}-{LI} in addition to chromogranin (Cg)-A improved the sensitivity for neuroendocrine malignancy from 85 to 91\%, whereas combined use of {CgA} and {CgB} had a joint sensitivity of 89\%. Of 38 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, 71\% had plasma {CART}-{LI} levels greater than 150 pmol/liter, increasing to 95\% in those classified with progressive disease (n = 20, mean {CART}-{LI} 625 pmol/liter), compared with 80\% for {CgA}. Chromatographic analysis suggests that circulating {CART}-{LI} is present as one major form, which may correspond to {CART} (62-102) or another unknown form.


{CONCLUSIONS}

We demonstrate {CART}-{LI} as a specific tumor marker in patients with a range of neuroendocrine tumors. Used in combination with {CgA}, {CART}-{LI} measurement has the potential to improve sensitivity in diagnosis and follow-up of neuroendocrine tumors, in particular progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.},

The "intrinsic" gene list describing the subtypes was used to classify 344 primary breast tumors of lymph node-negative patients. Fisher exact tests were used to determine the association between a tumor subtype and a particular site of distant relapse in these patients who only received local treatment. Modulated genes and pathways were identified in the various groups using Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Global Testing. Bone relapse patients were most abundant in the luminal subtypes but were found less than expected in the basal subtype. The reverse was true for lung and brain relapse patients with the remark that absence of lung relapse was luminal A specific. Finally, a pleura relapse, although rare, was found almost exclusively in both luminal subtypes. Many differentially expressed genes were identified, of which several were in common in a subtype and the site to which the subtype preferentially relapsed. {WNT} signaling was up-regulated in the basal subtype and in brain-specific relapse, and down-modulated in the luminal B subtype and in bone-specific relapse. Focal adhesion was found up-regulated in the luminal A subtype but down-regulated in lung relapse. The five major molecular subtypes in breast cancer are evidently different with regard to their ability to metastasize to distant organ(s), and share biological features and pathways with their preferred distant metastatic site.},

Variation in transcriptional programs accounts for much of the biological diversity of human cells and tumours. In each cell, signal transduction and regulatory systems transduce information from the cell's identity to its environmental status, thereby controlling the level of expression of every gene in the genome. Here we have characterized variation in gene expression patterns in a set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumours from 42 different individuals, using complementary {DNA} microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. These patterns provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumour. Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. Sets of co-expressed genes were identified for which variation in messenger {RNA} levels could be related to specific features of physiological variation. The tumours could be classified into subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns.},

Suppose that two sets of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse {CCA} is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other. It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse {CCA} methodology. (1) Sparse {CCA} is an unsupervised method; that is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We propose an extension to sparse {CCA}, which we call sparse supervised {CCA}, which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on the same set of samples; for instance, {SNP}, gene expression, and {DNA} copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse multiple {CCA} in order to extend the sparse {CCA} methodology to the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set.},

	abstract = {Modern high-throughput methods allow the investigation of biological functions across multiple 'omics' levels. Levels include {mRNA} and protein expression profiling as well as additional knowledge on, for example, {DNA} methylation and {microRNA} regulation. The reason for this interest in multi-omics is that actual cellular responses to different conditions are best explained mechanistically when taking all omics levels into account. To map gene products to their biological functions, public ontologies like Gene Ontology are commonly used. Many methods have been developed to identify terms in an ontology, overrepresented within a set of genes. However, these methods are not able to appropriately deal with any combination of several data types. Here, we propose a new method to analyse integrated data across multiple omics-levels to simultaneously assess their biological meaning. We developed a model-based Bayesian method for inferring interpretable term probabilities in a modular framework. Our Multi-level {ONtology} Analysis ({MONA}) algorithm performed significantly better than conventional analyses of individual levels and yields best results even for sophisticated models including {mRNA} fine-tuning by {microRNAs}. The {MONA} framework is flexible enough to allow for different underlying regulatory motifs or ontologies.

	abstract = {Although ovarian cancer is often initially chemotherapy-sensitive, the vast majority of tumors eventually relapse and patients die of increasingly aggressive disease. Cancer stem cells are believed to have properties that allow them to survive therapy and may drive recurrent tumor growth. Cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells are a rare cell population and difficult to isolate experimentally. Genes that are expressed by stem cells may characterize a subset of less differentiated tumors and aid in prognostic classification of ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was the genomic identification and characterization of a subtype of ovarian cancer that has stem cell-like gene expression. Using human and mouse gene signatures of embryonic, adult, or cancer stem cells, we performed an unsupervised bipartition class discovery on expression profiles from 145 serous ovarian tumors to identify a stem-like and more differentiated subgroup. Subtypes were reproducible and were further characterized in four independent, heterogeneous ovarian cancer datasets. We identified a stem-like subtype characterized by a 51-gene signature, which is significantly enriched in tumors with properties of Type {II} ovarian cancer; high grade, serous tumors, and poor survival. Conversely, the differentiated tumors share properties with Type I, including lower grade and mixed histological subtypes. The stem cell-like signature was prognostic within high-stage serous ovarian cancer, classifying a small subset of high-stage tumors with better prognosis, in the differentiated subtype. In multivariate models that adjusted for common clinical factors (including grade, stage, age), the subtype classification was still a significant predictor of relapse. The prognostic stem-like gene signature yields new insights into prognostic differences in ovarian cancer, provides a genomic context for defining Type I/{II} subtypes, and potential gene targets which following further validation may be valuable in the clinical management or treatment of ovarian cancer.},

Several in silico methods for deconvoluting a gene expression profile into cell-type-specific subprofiles have been published but not widely used. Here, we consider recent methods and the experimental validations available for them. Shen-Orr et al. recently developed an approach called cell-type-specific significance analysis of microarray for deconvoluting gene expression. This method requires the measurement of the proportion of each cell type in each sample and the expression profiles of the heterogeneous samples. It determines how gene expression varies among pre-defined phenotypes for each cell type. Gene expression can vary substantially among cell types and sample heterogeneity can mask the identification of biologically important phenotypic correlations. Consequently, the deconvolution approach can be useful in the analysis of mixtures of cell populations in clinical samples.

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that human genomic variations are associated with an individual’s susceptibility to complex diseases such as cancers and autoimmune diseases. However, extensive genome-wide association studies thus far had limited success because the results have low predictive value of practical utility to individuals. We present a prediction process where two machine-learning analysis methods are applied to two different descriptors of each individual’s common genomic variations to predict an individual’s susceptibility to eight major cancer traits. The accuracy of the prediction ranges from 33\% to 57\% depending on cancer type, which is significantly better than 11\% for a random prediction, with probability estimates that may be useful for making practical health decisions for individuals or for a population., An empirical approach is presented for predicting the genomic susceptibility of an individual to the most likely one among nine traits, consisting of eight major cancer classes plus a healthy trait. We use four prediction methods by applying two supervised learning algorithms to two different descriptors of common genomic variations (the profiles of genotypes of {SNPs} and {SNP} syntaxes with low P values or low frequencies) of each individual genome from normal cells. All four methods made correct predictions substantially better than random predictions for most cancer classes, but not for some others. A combination of the four results using Bayesian inference better predicted overall than any individual method. The multiclass accuracy of the combined prediction ranges from 33\% to 56\% depending on cancer classes of testing sets, compared with 11\% for a random prediction among nine traits. Despite limited {SNP} data available and the absence of rare {SNPs} in public databases, at present, the results suggest that the framework of this approach or its improvement can predict cancer susceptibility with probability estimates useful for making health decisions for individuals or for a population.},

It regulates protein secretion, for example translationally controlled tumor protein ({TCTP}), which is implicated in tumor reversion. In keeping with the latter, we show herein that {TSAP}6 is a glycosylated protein present in the trans-Golgi network, endosomal-vesicular compartment and cytoplasmic membrane. To further investigate the physiological function of {TSAP}6, we have generated {TSAP}6-deficient mice. These mice exhibit microcytic anemia with abnormal reticulocyte maturation and deficient transferrin receptor downregulation, a process known to be dependent on exosomal secretion. Moreover, we provide direct evidence that exosome production is severely compromised in {TSAP}6-null cells. Finally, we show that the {DNA} damage-induced p53-dependent nonclassical exosomal secretory pathway is abrogated in {TSAP}6-null cells. Given the fact that exosomes are used as cell-free vaccines against cancer and that they could be involved in the biogenesis and spread of human immunodeficiency virus, it is important to understand their regulation. The results presented here provide the first genetic demonstration that exosome formation is a tightly controlled biological process dependent of {TSAP}6.},

To date, 71 loci have thus been identified and replicated. More than 320,000 {SNPs} at these loci define {BCa} risk due to linkage disequilibrium ({LD}). We propose that {BCa} risk resides in a subgroup of {SNPs} that functionally affects breast biology. Such a shortlist will aid in framing hypotheses to prioritize a manageable number of likely disease-causing {SNPs}. We extracted all the {SNPs}, residing in 1 Mb windows around breast cancer risk index {SNP} from the 1000 genomes project to find correlated {SNPs}. We used {FunciSNP}, an R/Bioconductor package developed in-house, to identify potentially functional {SNPs} at 71 risk loci by coinciding them with chromatin biofeatures. We identified 1,005 {SNPs} in {LD} with the index {SNPs} (r2≥0.5) in three categories; 21 in exons of 18 genes, 76 in transcription start site ({TSS}) regions of 25 genes, and 921 in enhancers. Thirteen {SNPs} were found in more than one category. We found two correlated and predicted non-benign coding variants (rs8100241 in exon 2 and rs8108174 in exon 3) of the gene, {ANKLE}1. Most putative functional {LD} {SNPs}, however, were found in either epigenetically defined enhancers or in gene {TSS} regions. Fifty-five percent of these non-coding {SNPs} are likely functional, since they affect response element ({RE}) sequences of transcription factors. Functionality of these {SNPs} was assessed by expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) analysis and allele-specific enhancer assays. Unbiased analyses of {SNPs} at {BCa} risk loci revealed new and overlooked mechanisms that may affect risk of the disease, thereby providing a valuable resource for follow-up studies.},

{RESULTS}: Using a statistical method that permits estimating the relative proportion of cell types from {DNA} methylation profiles, we examine data from five previously published studies, and find strong evidence of cell composition change across age in blood. We also demonstrate that, in these studies, cellular composition explains much of the observed variability in {DNA} methylation.

To ensure optimal survival, it is important to diagnose this condition when the pathology is confined to the ovary. However, this is difficult to achieve because the first specific symptoms appear only during advanced disease stages. To date, the biomarker mainly used for the diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian cancer is {CA}125; however, this marker has a low sensitivity and specificity and is associated with several other physiological and pathological conditions. No other serum ovarian cancer markers appear to be able to replace or complement {CA}125, and the current challenge is therefore to identify novel markers for the early diagnosis of this disease. For this purpose, studies have focused on the microvesicles ({MVs}) released from tumor cells. {MVs} may represent an ideal biomarker because they can be easily isolated from blood, and they have particular features (mainly regarding {microRNA} profiles) that strongly correlate with ovarian cancer stage and may be effective for early diagnosis.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Prognostic and predictive factors are well established in early-stage breast cancer, but less is known about which metastatic sites will be affected.


{METHODS}

Patients with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed between 1986 and 1992 with archival tissue were included. Subtypes were defined as luminal A, luminal B, luminal/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2), {HER}2 enriched, basal-like, and triple negative ({TN}) nonbasal. Distant sites were classified as brain, liver, lung, bone, distant nodal, pleural/peritoneal, and other. Cumulative incidence curves were estimated for each site according to competing risks methods. Association between the site of relapse and subtype was assessed in multivariate models using logistic regression.


{RESULTS}

Median follow-up time among 3,726 eligible patients was 14.8 years. Median durations of survival with distant metastasis were 2.2 (luminal A), 1.6 (luminal B), 1.3 (luminal/{HER}2), 0.7 ({HER}2 enriched), and 0.5 years (basal-like; P {\textless} .001). Bone was the most common metastatic site in all subtypes except basal-like tumors. In multivariate analysis, compared with luminal A tumors, luminal/{HER}2 and {HER}2-enriched tumors were associated with a significantly higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases. Basal-like tumors had a higher rate of brain, lung, and distant nodal metastases but a significantly lower rate of liver and bone metastases. {TN} nonbasal tumors demonstrated a similar pattern but were not associated with fewer liver metastases.


{CONCLUSION}

Breast cancer subtypes are associated with distinct patterns of metastatic spread with notable differences in survival after relapse.},

We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival, and Cox's regression analysis to estimate the mortality rate ratio ({MRR}) by the presence of bone metastases with and without {SREs}, adjusting for age and comorbidity. The 5-year survival was 75.8\% for breast cancer patients without bone metastases, 8.3\% for patients with bone metastases, and 2.5\% for those with both bone metastases and {SREs}. The adjusted {MRR} was 10.5 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 9.5-11.6] for breast cancer patients with bone metastases, and 14.4 (95\% {CI} 13.1-15.8) for those with bone metastases and {SREs}, compared with breast cancer patients with no bone metastases but possibly other sites of metastases. A similar pattern persisted when analyses were stratified by stage or treatment.

We first evaluated {GRAIL} by assessing its ability to identify subsets of highly related genes in common pathways from validated lipid and height {SNP} associations from recent genome-wide studies. We then tested {GRAIL}, by assessing its ability to separate true disease regions from many false positive disease regions in two separate practical applications in human genetics. First, we took 74 nominally associated Crohn's disease {SNPs} and applied {GRAIL} to identify a subset of 13 {SNPs} with highly related genes. Of these, ten convincingly validated in follow-up genotyping; genotyping results for the remaining three were inconclusive. Next, we applied {GRAIL} to 165 rare deletion events seen in schizophrenia cases (less than one-third of which are contributing to disease risk). We demonstrate that {GRAIL} is able to identify a subset of 16 deletions containing highly related genes; many of these genes are expressed in the central nervous system and play a role in neuronal synapses. {GRAIL} offers a statistically robust approach to identifying functionally related genes from across multiple disease regions--that likely represent key disease pathways.

The 70-gene prognosis-signature is a prognostic tool for early breast cancer analysis. In addition to scientific evidence, implementation of the signature in clinical trials and daily practice requires logistical feasibility. The aim of our study was to test logistics for gene expression profiling on fresh frozen tumour tissue in the preparation for the prospective, multinational Microarray In Node-negative Disease may Avoid {ChemoTherapy} ({MINDACT}) trial.


{METHODS}

Sixty-four patients were included in six European hospitals. Fresh frozen tumour samples were shipped on dry ice to Agendia B.V., where {RNA} was isolated and subsequently hybridised on the 70-gene prognosis-signature ({MammaPrint}).


{RESULTS}

Tumour samples were obtained in 60 of 64 patients. Among the 60 samples, 11 contained insufficient tumour cells ({\textless}50\%) and three contained insufficient {RNA} quality. All 46 samples eligible for genomic profiling were successfully hybridised, and the results were reported on average within 4-5d.

Genome-scale expression profiling has identified new subtypes of cancer based on consistent patterns of variation in gene expression, leading to improved prognostic predictions. However, how these new genetic subtypes of cancers should be treated is unknown. Here, we show that a gene module map can guide the prospective identification of targeted therapies for genetic subtypes of cancer. By visualizing genome-scale gene expression in cancer as combinations of activated and deactivated functional modules, gene module maps can reveal specific functional pathways associated with each subtype that might be susceptible to targeted therapies. We show that in human breast cancers, activation of a poor-prognosis “wound signature” is strongly associated with induction of both a mitochondria gene module and a proteasome gene module. We found that 3-bromopyruvic acid, which inhibits glycolysis, selectively killed breast cells expressing the mitochondria and wound signatures. In addition, inhibition of proteasome activity by bortezomib, a drug approved for human use in multiple myeloma, abrogated wound signature expression and selectively killed breast cells expressing the wound signature. Thus, gene module maps may enable rapid translation of complex genomic signatures in human disease to targeted therapeutic strategies. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):369–78]},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Several gene sets for prediction of breast cancer survival have been derived from whole-genome {mRNA} expression profiles. Here, we develop a statistical framework to explore whether combination of the information from such sets may improve prediction of recurrence and breast cancer specific death in early-stage breast cancers. Microarray data from two clinically similar cohorts of breast cancer patients are used as training (n = 123) and test set (n = 81), respectively. Gene sets from eleven previously published gene signatures are included in the study.


{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}

To investigate the relationship between breast cancer survival and gene expression on a particular gene set, a Cox proportional hazards model is applied using partial likelihood regression with an L2 penalty to avoid overfitting and using cross-validation to determine the penalty weight. The fitted models are applied to an independent test set to obtain a predicted risk for each individual and each gene set. Hierarchical clustering of the test individuals on the basis of the vector of predicted risks results in two clusters with distinct clinical characteristics in terms of the distribution of molecular subtypes, {ER}, {PR} status, {TP}53 mutation status and histological grade category, and associated with significantly different survival probabilities (recurrence: p = 0.005; breast cancer death: p = 0.014). Finally, principal components analysis of the gene signatures is used to derive combined predictors used to fit a new Cox model. This model classifies test individuals into two risk groups with distinct survival characteristics (recurrence: p = 0.003; breast cancer death: p = 0.001). The latter classifier outperforms all the individual gene signatures, as well as Cox models based on traditional clinical parameters and the Adjuvant! Online for survival prediction.


{CONCLUSION}

Combining the predictive strength of multiple gene signatures improves prediction of breast cancer survival. The presented methodology is broadly applicable to breast cancer risk assessment using any new identified gene set.},

	abstract = {Autophagy is an important homeostatic cellular recycling mechanism responsible for degrading unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular organelles and proteins in all living cells. Autophagy is particularly active during metabolic stress. In the cancer cell it fulfils a dual role, having tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing properties. Functional autophagy prevents necrosis and inflammation, which can lead to genetic instability. On the other hand, autophagy might be important for tumor progression by providing energy through its recycling mechanism during unfavorable metabolic circumstances. A central checkpoint that negatively regulates autophagy is {mTOR}, and anticancer drugs inhibiting the {PI}3K/Akt/{mTOR} axis putatively stimulate autophagy. However, whether autophagy contributes to the antitumor effect of these drugs or to drug resistance is largely unknown. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit autophagy, leading to increased cytotoxicity in combination with several anticancer drugs in preclinical models. The therapeutic clinical roles of autophagy induction and inhibition remain to be defined. To improve our understanding of autophagy in human cancers new methods for measuring autophagy in clinical samples need to be developed. This Review delineates the possible role of autophagy as a novel target for anticancer therapy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Growth rate is a major determinant of intracellular function. However its effects can only be properly dissected with technically demanding chemostat cultivations in which it can be controlled. Recent work on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chemostat cultivations provided the first analysis on genome wide effects of growth rate. In this work we study the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) that is an industrial protein production host known for its exceptional protein secretion capability. Interestingly, it exhibits a low growth rate protein production phenotype.
{RESULTS}: We have used transcriptomics and proteomics to study the effect of growth rate and cell density on protein production in chemostat cultivations of T. reesei. Use of chemostat allowed control of growth rate and exact estimation of the extracellular specific protein production rate ({SPPR}). We find that major biosynthetic activities are all negatively correlated with {SPPR}. We also find that expression of many genes of secreted proteins and secondary metabolism, as well as various lineage specific, mostly unknown genes are positively correlated with {SPPR}. Finally, we enumerate possible regulators and regulatory mechanisms, arising from the data, for this response.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Based on these results it appears that in low growth rate protein production energy is very efficiently used primarly for protein production. Also, we propose that flux through early glycolysis or the {TCA} cycle is a more fundamental determining factor than growth rate for low growth rate protein production and we propose a novel eukaryotic response to this i.e. the lineage specific response ({LSR}).},

	abstract = {Hyperactive inflammatory responses following cancer initiation have led to cancer being described as a 'wound that never heals'. These inflammatory responses elicit signals via {NFκB} leading to {IL}-6 production, and {IL}-6 in turn has been shown to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells in vitro, implicating a role for this cytokine in cancer cell invasion. We previously have shown that conditioned medium derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts induced an Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition ({EMT}) in {PMC}42-{LA} breast cancer cells and we have now identify {IL}-6 as present in this medium. We further show that {IL}-6 is expressed approximately 100 fold higher in a cancer-associated fibroblast line compared to normal fibroblasts. Comparison of mouse-specific (stroma) and human-specific (tumor) {IL}-6 {mRNA} expression from {MCF}-7, {MDA} {MB} 468 and {MDA} {MB} 231 xenografts also indicated the stroma rather than tumor as a significantly higher source of {IL}-6 expression. Mast cells ({MCs}) feature in inflammatory cancer-associated stroma, and activated {MCs} secrete {IL}-6. We observed a higher {MC} index (average number of mast cells per xenograft section/average tumor size) in {MDA} {MB} 468 compared to {MDA} {MB} 231 xenografts, where all {MC} were observed to be active (degranulating). This higher {MC} index correlated with greater mouse-specific {IL}-6 expression in the {MDA} {MB} 468 xenografts, implicating {MC} as an important source of stromal {IL}-6. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry on these xenografts for {pSTAT}3, which lies downstream of the {IL}-6 receptor indicated frequent correlations between {pSTAT}3 and mast cell positive cells. Analysis of publically available databases for {IL}-6 expression in patient tissue revealed higher {IL}-6 in laser capture microdissected stroma compared to adjacent tissue epithelium from patients with inflammatory breast cancer ({IBC}) and invasive non-inflammatory breast cancer (non-{IBC}) and we show that {IL}-6 expression was significantly higher in Basal versus Luminal molecular/phenotypic groupings of breast cancer cell lines.

	abstract = {Experimentally characterized enhancer regions have previously been shown to display specific patterns of enrichment for several different histone modifications. We modelled these enhancer chromatin profiles in the human genome and used them to guide the search for novel enhancers derived from transposable element ({TE}) sequences. To do this, a computational approach was taken to analyze the genome-wide histone modification landscape characterized by the {ENCODE} project in two human hematopoietic cell types, {GM}12878 and K562. We predicted the locations of 2,107 and 1,448 {TE}-derived enhancers in the {GM}12878 and K562 cell lines respectively. A vast majority of these putative enhancers are unique to each cell line; only 3.5\% of the {TE}-derived enhancers are shared between the two. We evaluated the functional effect of {TE}-derived enhancers by associating them with the cell-type specific expression of nearby genes, and found that the number of {TE}-derived enhancers is strongly positively correlated with the expression of nearby genes in each cell line. Furthermore, genes that are differentially expressed between the two cell lines also possess a divergent number of {TE}-derived enhancers in their vicinity. As such, genes that are up-regulated in the {GM}12878 cell line and down-regulated in K562 have significantly more {TE}-derived enhancers in their vicinity in the {GM}12878 cell line and vice versa. These data indicate that human {TE}-derived sequences are likely to be involved in regulating cell-type specific gene expression on a broad scale and suggest that the enhancer activity of {TE}-derived sequences is mediated by epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.},

For hematopoietic malignancies, a classification scheme based on the phenotypic similarity between tumor cells and normal cells has been successfully used to define tumor subtypes; however, use of normal cell types as a reference by which to classify solid tumors has not been widely emulated, in part due to more limited understanding of epithelial cell differentiation compared with hematopoiesis. To provide a better definition of the subtypes of epithelial cells comprising the breast epithelium, we performed a systematic analysis of a large set of breast epithelial markers in more than 15,000 normal breast cells, which identified 11 differentiation states for normal luminal cells. We then applied information from this analysis to classify human breast tumors based on normal cell types into 4 major subtypes, {HR}0-{HR}3, which were differentiated by vitamin D, androgen, and estrogen hormone receptor ({HR}) expression. Examination of 3,157 human breast tumors revealed that these {HR} subtypes were distinct from the current classification scheme, which is based on estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Patient outcomes were best when tumors expressed all 3 hormone receptors (subtype {HR}3) and worst when they expressed none of the receptors (subtype {HR}0). Together, these data provide an ontological classification scheme associated with patient survival differences and provides actionable insights for treating breast tumors.},

	abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Efforts at early detection and new therapeutic approaches to reduce mortality have been largely unsuccessful, because the origin and pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer are poorly understood. Despite numerous studies that have carefully scrutinized the ovaries for precursor lesions, none have been found. This has led to the proposal that ovarian cancer develops de novo. Studies have shown that epithelial ovarian cancer is not a single disease but is composed of a diverse group of tumors that can be classified based on distinctive morphologic and molecular genetic features. One group of tumors, designated type I, is composed of low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous and transitional (Brenner) carcinomas. These tumors generally behave in an indolent fashion, are confined to the ovary at presentation and, as a group, are relatively genetically stable. They lack mutations of {TP}53, but each histologic type exhibits a distinctive molecular genetic profile. Moreover, the carcinomas exhibit a shared lineage with the corresponding benign cystic neoplasm, often through an intermediate (borderline tumor) step, supporting the morphologic continuum of tumor progression. In contrast, another group of tumors, designated type {II}, is highly aggressive, evolves rapidly and almost always presents in advanced stage. Type {II} tumors include conventional high-grade serous carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, and malignant mixed mesodermal tumors (carcinosarcoma). They {displayTP}53 mutations in over 80\% of cases and rarely harbor the mutations that are found in the type I tumors. Recent studies have also provided cogent evidence that what have been traditionally thought to be primary ovarian tumors actually originate in other pelvic organs and involve the ovary secondarily. Thus, it has been proposed that serous tumors arise from the implantation of epithelium (benign or malignant) from the fallopian tube. Endometrioid and clear cell tumors have been associated with endometriosis that is regarded as the precursor of these tumors. As it is generally accepted that endometriosis develops from endometrial tissue by retrograde menstruation, it is reasonable to assume that the endometrium is the source of these ovarian neoplasms. Finally, preliminary data suggest that mucinous and transitional (Brenner) tumors arise from transitional-type epithelial nests at the tubal-mesothelial junction by a process of metaplasia. Appreciation of these new concepts will allow for a more rationale approach to screening, treatment, and prevention that potentially can have a significant impact on reducing the mortality of this devastating disease.},

In addition to networks of soluble mediators, cells are also programed to exchange complex messages pre-assembled as multimolecular cargo of membraneous structures known extracellular vesicles ({EV}). Several biogenetic pathways produce {EVs} with different properties, and known as exosomes, ectosomes, and apoptotic bodies. In cancer, {EVs} carry molecular signatures and effectors of the disease, such as mutant oncoproteins, oncogenic transcripts, {microRNA}, and {DNA} sequences. Intercellular trafficking of such {EVs} (oncosomes) may contribute to horizontal cellular transformation, phenotypic reprograming, and functional re-education of recipient cells, both locally and systemically.

Our comprehensive evaluation of {HOX} gene expression using tiling microarrays, with validation, showed that distant metastases from {TAM}-resistant patients also displayed high {HOXB}13 expression, suggesting a role for {HOXB}13 in tumor dissemination and survival. Here we show that {HOXB}13 confers {TAM} resistance by directly downregulating {ERα} transcription and protein expression. {HOXB}13 elevation promoted cell proliferation in vitro and growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Mechanistic investigations showed that {HOXB}13 transcriptionally upregulated interleukin ({IL})-6, activating the {mTOR} pathway via {STAT}3 phosphorylation to promote cell proliferation and fibroblast recruitment. Accordingly, {mTOR} inhibition suppressed fibroblast recruitment and proliferation of {HOXB}13-expressing {ER}+ breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts, alone or in combination with {TAM}.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Microarray expression profiling has been widely used to identify differentially expressed genes in complex cellular systems. However, while such methods can be used to directly infer intracellular regulation within homogeneous cell populations, interpretation of in vivo gene expression data derived from complex organs composed of multiple cell types is more problematic. Specifically, observed changes in gene expression may be due either to changes in gene regulation within a given cell type or to changes in the relative abundance of expressing cell types. Consequently, bona fide changes in intrinsic gene regulation may be either mimicked or masked by changes in the relative proportion of different cell types. To date, few analytical approaches have addressed this problem.


{RESULTS}

We have chosen to apply a computational method for deconvoluting gene expression profiles derived from intact tissues by using reference expression data for purified populations of the constituent cell types of the mammary gland. These data were used to estimate changes in the relative proportions of different cell types during murine mammary gland development and Ras-induced mammary tumorigenesis. These computational estimates of changing compartment sizes were then used to enrich lists of differentially expressed genes for transcripts that change as a function of intrinsic intracellular regulation rather than shifts in the relative abundance of expressing cell types. Using this approach, we have demonstrated that adjusting mammary gene expression profiles for changes in three principal compartments--epithelium, white adipose tissue, and brown adipose tissue--is sufficient both to reduce false-positive changes in gene expression due solely to changes in compartment sizes and to reduce false-negative changes by unmasking genuine alterations in gene expression that were otherwise obscured by changes in compartment sizes.


{CONCLUSION}

By adjusting gene expression values for changes in the sizes of cell type-specific compartments, this computational deconvolution method has the potential to increase both the sensitivity and specificity of differential gene expression experiments performed on complex tissues. Given the necessity for understanding complex biological processes such as development and carcinogenesis within the context of intact tissues, this approach offers substantial utility and should be broadly applicable to identifying gene expression changes in tissues composed of multiple cell types.},

Such data provide unique opportunities to study the coordination between regulatory mechanisms on multiple levels. However, integrative analysis of multi-dimensional genomics data for the discovery of combinatorial patterns is currently lacking. Here, we adopt a joint matrix factorization technique to address this challenge. This method projects multiple types of genomic data onto a common coordinate system, in which heterogeneous variables weighted highly in the same projected direction form a multi-dimensional module (md-module). Genomic variables in such modules are characterized by significant correlations and likely functional associations. We applied this method to the {DM}, {GE}, and {microRNA} expression data of 385 ovarian cancer samples from the The Cancer Genome Atlas project. These md-modules revealed perturbed pathways that would have been overlooked with only a single type of data, uncovered associations between different layers of cellular activities and allowed the identification of clinically distinct patient subgroups. Our study provides an useful protocol for uncovering hidden patterns and their biological implications in multi-dimensional 'omic' data.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ({MTBC}) can be classified into major lineages based on their genotype. Further subdivision of major lineages into sublineages requires multiple biomarkers along with methods to combine and analyze multiple sources of information in one unsupervised learning model. Typically, spacer oligonucleotide type (spoligotype) and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units ({MIRU}) are used for {TB} genotyping and surveillance. Here, we examine the sublineage structure of {MTBC} strains with multiple biomarkers simultaneously, by employing a tensor clustering framework ({TCF}) on multiple-biomarker tensors.
{RESULTS}: Simultaneous analysis of the spoligotype and {MIRU} type of strains using {TCF} on multiple-biomarker tensors leads to coherent sublineages of major lineages with clear and distinctive spoligotype and {MIRU} signatures. Comparison of tensor sublineages with {SpolDB}4 families either supports tensor sublineages, or suggests subdivision or merging of {SpolDB}4 families. High prediction accuracy of major lineage classification with supervised tensor learning on multiple-biomarker tensors validates our unsupervised analysis of sublineages on multiple-biomarker tensors.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {TCF} on multiple-biomarker tensors achieves simultaneous analysis of multiple biomarkers and suggest a new putative sublineage structure for each major lineage. Analysis of multiple-biomarker tensors gives insight into the sublineage structure of {MTBC} at the genomic level.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are bioactive vesicles derived from the cell's endosomal membrane system and secreted into surrounding body fluids. Exosomes contain cell and cell-state specific cargos of protein, {mRNA} and {miRNA}. Exosome formation, cargo content, and delivery to surrounding cells is of immense biological interest considering the role that exosomes are believed to play in various pathological conditions. They aid antigen presentation by immune cells and can exhibit either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory properties depending on the parent antigen-presenting cell's conditioning. Viruses can hijack a host cell's exosomal machinery to evade host defense systems aiding in the trans-infection of viruses. Tumor derived exosomes may help establish an oncogenic niche systemically via delivery of protein, {mRNA}, and {miRNA} that can aid angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Exosomes have also been implicated in the spread of neurodegenerative diseases. Studies have shown that exosomes are selectively taken up by cells distal from their release. They can reprogram the recipient cells due to their active molecular cargo. Cell-lineage and state-specific exosomes imply that they may therefore harbor body fluid-based biomarkers of unparalleled accuracy, particularly for tissues that are difficult or impossible to access. Exosome-specific membrane proteins provide markers enabling exosome identity and selection, while cell type and cell condition-specific protein, {mRNA} and {miRNA} cargo provide a rich potential source of biomarkers. This review serves to provide an overview of the current state of the science in the burgeoning field of exosome biology.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, is a major regulator of tumor development and aggressiveness. However, how cancer cells adapt to hypoxia and communicate with their surrounding microenvironment during tumor development remain important questions. Here, we show that secreted vesicles with exosome characteristics mediate hypoxia-dependent intercellular signaling of the highly malignant brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}). In vitro hypoxia experiments with glioma cells and studies with patient materials reveal the enrichment in exosomes of hypoxia-regulated {mRNAs} and proteins (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, {IL}-8, {PDGFs}, caveolin 1, and lysyl oxidase), several of which were associated with poor glioma patient prognosis. We show that exosomes derived from {GBM} cells grown at hypoxic compared with normoxic conditions are potent inducers of angiogenesis ex vivo and in vitro through phenotypic modulation of endothelial cells. Interestingly, endothelial cells were programmed by {GBM} cell-derived hypoxic exosomes to secrete several potent growth factors and cytokines and to stimulate pericyte {PI}3K/{AKT} signaling activation and migration. Moreover, exosomes derived from hypoxic compared with normoxic conditions showed increased autocrine, promigratory activation of {GBM} cells. These findings were correlated with significantly enhanced induction by hypoxic compared with normoxic exosomes of tumor vascularization, pericyte vessel coverage, {GBM} cell proliferation, as well as decreased tumor hypoxia in a mouse xenograft model. We conclude that the proteome and {mRNA} profiles of exosome vesicles closely reflect the oxygenation status of donor glioma cells and patient tumors, and that the exosomal pathway constitutes a potentially targetable driver of hypoxia-dependent intercellular signaling during tumor development.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002875},
	abstract = {A major goal in translational cancer research is to identify biological signatures driving cancer progression and metastasis. A common technique applied in genomics research is to cluster patients using gene expression data from a candidate prognostic gene set, and if the resulting clusters show statistically significant outcome stratification, to associate the gene set with prognosis, suggesting its biological and clinical importance. Recent work has questioned the validity of this approach by showing in several breast cancer data sets that "random" gene sets tend to cluster patients into prognostically variable subgroups. This work suggests that new rigorous statistical methods are needed to identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets. To address this problem, we developed Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures ({SAPS}) which integrates standard prognostic tests with a new prognostic significance test based on stratifying patients into prognostic subtypes with random gene sets. {SAPS} ensures that a significant gene set is not only able to stratify patients into prognostically variable groups, but is also enriched for genes showing strong univariate associations with patient prognosis, and performs significantly better than random gene sets. We use {SAPS} to perform a large meta-analysis (the largest completed to date) of prognostic pathways in breast and ovarian cancer and their molecular subtypes. Our analyses show that only a small subset of the gene sets found statistically significant using standard measures achieve significance by {SAPS}. We identify new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer and their corresponding molecular subtypes, and we show that prognostic signatures in {ER} negative breast cancer are more similar to prognostic signatures in ovarian cancer than to prognostic signatures in {ER} positive breast cancer. {SAPS} is a powerful new method for deriving robust prognostic biological signatures from clinically annotated genomic datasets.},

We present a validation study to assess the prognostic significance in lymph node-negative, premenopausal patients from the perioperative chemotherapy trial ({POP} trial, 10854) conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. The {POP} trial assessed the efficacy of one course of perioperative chemotherapy (consisting of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained sections were retrieved from a subset of premenopausal, node-negative patients from this trial and were scored for the percentage of intra-tumoral stroma. The tumor-stroma ratio was associated with disease-free survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. Tumors with a high tumor-stroma ratio had an increased hazard of 1.853 for disease relapse (95 \%{CI} 1.327-2.585, P {\textless} 0.001) independent of other parameters. Combining other parameters with the tumor-stroma ratio improved risk stratification. For triple-negative tumors, the tumor-stroma ratio was associated with an increased hazard for disease relapse, independent of other parameters ({HR} 2.711, 95 \%{CI} 1.111-6.614, P = 0.028). The tumor-stroma ratio was also independently associated with locoregional recurrence even in breast cancer patients ≤40 years of age ({HR} 2.201, 95 \%{CI} 1.038-4.669, P = 0.040). This study validates the prognostic value of the tumor-stroma ratio.

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence support the association between the use of hormone replacement therapy ({HRT}) and a higher risk of both invasive lobular carcinoma ({ILC}) and invasive ductal-lobular mixed carcinoma ({IDLC}). Overall biological and clinical features of {ILC} entail a more cautious diagnostic and therapeutic approach as compared with invasive ductal carcinoma ({IDC}). {ILCs} are more frequently multifocal, multicentric and/or bilateral. Mammography and ultrasound show, therefore, significant limitations, while the higher sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of multifocal and/or multicentric lesions seems to improve the accuracy of preoperative staging of {ILCs}. Early diagnosis is even more challenging because the difficult in the localization and the sparse cellularity of lobular tumours may determine a false negative core biopsy. {ILC} is characterized by low proliferative activity, C-{ErbB}-2 negativity, bcl-2 positivity, p53 and {VEGF} negativity, oestrogen and progesterone positive receptors, low grade and low likelihood of lymphatic-vascular invasion. However, this more favourable biological behaviour does not reflect into a better disease-free and overall survival as compared with {IDC}. Since lobular histology is associated with a higher risk of positive margins, mastectomy is often preferred to breast conservative surgery. Moreover, only few patients with {ILC} achieve a pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy and, therefore, in most patients mastectomy can be regarded as the safer surgical treatment. The preoperative staging and the follow-up of patients with {ILC} are also complicated by the particular metastatic pattern of such histotype. In fact, metastases are more frequently distributed to the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum/retroperitoneum and gynaecological organs than in {IDC}.},

The conceptual framework established by these studies converged on three important aspects. First, subtypes in each tumor group originate from distinct cell types. Second, each cell-of-origin is uniquely susceptible to some but not other genetic mutations. Lastly, mutant stem cells may not transform until they differentiate into more restricted progenitor cell type.

Exosomes are smaller vesicles (≤100nm) having an endocytic origin and released upon multivesicular body fusion with the plasma membrane. Both vesicle types play major roles in intercellular cross talk and constitute an important component of the secretome especially in the area of biomarkers for cancer. The release of {EVs}, which are found in all the bodily fluids, is enhanced in cancer and a major focus of cancer proteomics is therefore targeted at {EVs}.

The corresponding mouse allele, Mcm4(Chaos3), predisposes mice to mammary gland tumors. While mcm4(Chaos3) causes replication stress in both haploid and diploid yeast, only diploid mutants exhibit G2/M delay, severe genetic instability ({GIN}), and reduced viability. These different outcomes are associated with distinct repair pathways adopted in haploid and diploid mutants. Haploid mutants use the Rad6-dependent pathways that resume stalled forks, whereas the diploid mutants use the Rad52- and {MRX}-dependent pathways that repair double strand breaks. The repair pathway choice is irreversible and not regulated by the availability of repair enzymes. This ploidy effect is independent of mating type heterozygosity and not further enhanced by increasing ploidy. In summary, a defective {MCM} helicase causes {GIN} only in particular cell types. In response to replication stress, early events associated with ploidy dictate the repair pathway choice. This study uncovers a fundamental difference between haplophase and diplophase in the maintenance of genome integrity.},

	abstract = {{STATIS} is an extension of principal component analysis ({PCA}) tailored to handle multiple data tables that measure sets of variables collected on the same observations, or, alternatively, as in a variant called dual-{STATIS}, multiple data tables where the same variables are measured on different sets of observations. {STATIS} proceeds in two steps: First it analyzes the between data table similarity structure and derives from this analysis an optimal set of weights that are used to compute a linear combination of the data tables called the compromise that best represents the information common to the different data tables; Second, the {PCA} of this compromise gives an optimal map of the observations. Each of the data tables also provides a map of the observations that is in the same space as the optimum compromise map. In this article, we present {STATIS}, explain the criteria that it optimizes, review the recent inferential extensions to {STATIS} and illustrate it with a detailed example. We also review, and present in a common framework, the main developments of {STATIS} such as (1) X-{STATIS} or partial triadic analysis ({PTA}) which is used when all data tables collect the same variables measured on the same observations (e.g., at different times or locations), (2) {COVSTATIS}, which handles multiple covariance matrices collected on the same observations, (3) {DISTATIS}, which handles multiple distance matrices collected on the same observations and generalizes metric multidimensional scaling to three way distance matrices, (4) Canonical-{STATIS} ({CANOSTATIS}), which generalizes discriminant analysis and combines it with {DISTATIS} to analyze multitable discriminant analysis problems, (5) power-{STATIS}, which uses alternative criteria to find {STATIS} optimal weights, (6) {ANISOSTATIS}, which extends {STATIS} to give specific weights to each variable rather than to each whole table, (7) (K + 1)-{STATIS} (or external-{STATIS}), which extends {STATIS} (and {PLS}-methods and Tucker inter battery analysis) to the analysis of the relationships of several data sets and one external data set, and (8) double-{STATIS} (or {DO}-{ACT}), which generalizes (K + 1)-{STATIS} and analyzes two sets of data tables, and {STATIS}-4, which generalizes double-{STATIS} to more than two sets of data.

	abstract = {Hypoxia enhances the proliferation and migration of adipose-derived stem cells ({ASCs}) via the generation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}). Therefore, this study primarily investigated whether or not {ROS} generation could regulate {microRNA}-210 ({miR}-210) expression, and increase proliferation/migration of {ASCs}. In addition, we tried to identify the signaling pathways involved in {miR}-210 upregulation and the direct target genes of {miR}-210 that mediate these functions. Various sources of {ROS} generation such as hypoxia, antimycin, rotenone, and platelet-derived growth factor ({PDGF})-{BB} upregulated {miR}-210 expression, and increased the proliferation/migration of {ASCs}. There is a positive feed-forward loop between {ROS} generation and {miR}-210, and {miR}-210 itself increases {ROS} generation by downregulation of iron–sulfur cluster scaffold homolog 2 ({ISCU}2). Although hypoxia-inducible factor-1α was not involved in {miR}-210 expression, pharmacological or small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA})-driven inhibition of Akt and {ERK}1/2 molecules reduced {miR}-210 expression. Transfection of {siRNAs} of {NF}-κB and Elk1 also reduced {miR}-210 expression, indicating that these signaling pathways mediate {miR}-210 upregulation. Protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2 ({PTPN}2) was selected for {miR}-210 target gene, and it was downregulated by {ROS} generators or {miR}-210 mimic treatment. {PTPN}2 was first proven to be a direct {miR}-210 target in luciferase activity assay, and pharmacological inhibition or overexpression of {PTPN}2 regulated the proliferation and migration of {ASC}. In conclusion, {ROS} generation from diverse sources induces {miR}-210 expression in {ASCs} via {PDGFR}-β, Akt and {ERK} pathways. Transcription of {miR}-210 expression is regulated by {NF}-κB and Elk1, and {miR}-210 increases the proliferation and migration of {ASCs} via {ISCU}2 and {PTPN}2 downregulation.},

	abstract = {Disruption of the {BRCA}2 tumor suppressor is associated with structural and numerical chromosomal defects. The numerical abnormalities in {BRCA}2-deficient cells may partly result from aberrations in cell division caused by disruption of {BRCA}2 during cytokinesis. Here we show that {BRCA}2 is a component of the midbody that is recruited through an interaction with Filamin A actin-binding protein. At the midbody, {BRCA}2 influences the recruitment of endosomal sorting complex required for transport ({ESCRT})-associated proteins, Alix and Tsg101, and formation of {CEP}55-Alix and {CEP}55-Tsg101 complexes during abscission. Disruption of these {BRCA}2 interactions by cancer-associated mutations results in increased cytokinetic defects but has no effect on {BRCA}2-dependent homologous recombination repair of {DNA} damage. These findings identify a specific role for {BRCA}2 in the regulation of midbody structure and function, separate from {DNA} damage repair, that may explain in part the whole-chromosomal instability in {BRCA}2-deficient tumors.},

In the same way that understanding the availability of genetic variance within populations requires the simultaneous consideration of genetic variance in sets of functionally related traits, determining how genetic variance changes under selection in natural populations will require ascertaining how genetic variance-covariance (G) matrices evolve. Here, we develop a geometric framework using higher-order tensors, which enables the empirical characterization of how G matrices have diverged among populations. We then show how divergence among populations in genetic covariance structure can then be associated with divergence in selection acting on those traits using key equations from evolutionary theory. Using estimates of G matrices of eight male sexually selected traits from nine geographical populations of Drosophila serrata, we show that much of the divergence in genetic variance occurred in a single trait combination, a conclusion that could not have been reached by examining variation among the individual elements of the nine G matrices. Divergence in G was primarily in the direction of the major axes of genetic variance within populations, suggesting that genetic drift may be a major cause of divergence in genetic variance among these populations.},

We studied 11 ovarian serous carcinomas with features that were "intermediate" (nuclear grade 2) between low and high grade. All the cases were high staged and had a poor clinical outcome. None of the tumors showed mutations in {KRAS}, {BRAF}, and {ERBB}2 genes that characterize most low-grade serous carcinomas. In contrast, 10 (90.9\%) of 11 cases contained nonsynonymous {TP}53 mutations characteristic of high-grade serous carcinomas. In summary, the molecular genetic profile and behavior of serous carcinomas with grade 2 nuclei are virtually the same as those of serous carcinomas with grade 3 nuclei, supporting the use of the 2-tier grading system for classifying ovarian serous carcinomas.},

	abstract = {There is evidence that normal breast stromal fibroblasts ({NBFs}) suppress tumour growth, while cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) promote tumourigenesis through functional interactions with tumour cells. Little is known about the biology and the carcinogenic potential of stromal fibroblasts present in histologically normal surgical margins ({TCFs}). Therefore, we first undertook gene expression analysis on five {CAF}/{TCF} pairs from breast cancer patients and three {NBF} samples (derived from mammoplasties). This comparative analysis revealed variation in gene expression between these three categories of cells, with a {TCF}-specific gene expression profile. This variability was higher in {TCFs} than in their paired {CAFs} and also {NBFs}. Cytokine arrays show that {TCFs} have a specific secretory cytokine profile. In addition, stromal fibroblasts from surgical margins expressed high levels of α-{SMA} and {SDF}-1 and exhibited higher migratory/invasiveness abilities. Indirect co-culture showed that {TCF} cells enhance the proliferation of non-cancerous mammary epithelial cells and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells. Moreover, {TCF} and {CAF} cells increased the level of {PCNA}, {MMP}-2 and the phosphorylated/activated form of Akt in normal breast luminal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. Furthermore, {TCFs} were able to promote the formation and growth of humanized orthotopic breast tumours in nude mice. Interestingly, these {TCF} phenotypes and the extent of their effects were intermediate between those of {NBFs} and {CAFs}. Together, these results indicate that stromal fibroblasts located in non-cancerous tissues exhibit a tumour-promoting phenotype, indicating that their presence post-surgery may play important roles in cancer recurrence. © 2013 The Authors.

{RESULTS}: We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on three different test cases. Two of these test cases, the Lactate/Malate dehydrogenase family and Nucleotidyl Cyclases, consist of two functional groups. The other family, Serine Proteases consists of three groups. {BGA} was used to analyse and visualise these three families using two different encoding schemes for the amino acids.
{CONCLUSION}: This overall combination of methods in this paper is powerful and flexible while being computationally very fast and simple. {BGA} is especially useful because it can be used to analyse any number of functional classes.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: A gene expression signature indicative of activated wound responses is common to more than 90\% of non-neoplastic tissues adjacent to breast cancer, but these tissues also exhibit substantial heterogeneity. We hypothesized that gene expression subtypes of breast cancer microenvironment can be defined and that these microenvironment subtypes have clinical relevance.
{METHODS}: Gene expression was evaluated in 72 patient-derived breast tissue samples adjacent to invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Unsupervised clustering identified two distinct gene expression subgroups that differed in expression of genes involved in activation of fibrosis, cellular movement, cell adhesion and cell-cell contact. We evaluated the prognostic relevance of extratumoral subtype (comparing the Active group, defined by high expression of fibrosis and cellular movement genes, to the Inactive group, defined by high expression of claudins and other cellular adhesion and cell-cell contact genes) using clinical data. To establish the biological characteristics of these subtypes, gene expression profiles were compared against published and novel tumor and tumor stroma-derived signatures (Twist-related protein 1 ({TWIST}1) overexpression, transforming growth factor beta ({TGF}-β)-induced fibroblast activation, breast fibrosis, claudin-low tumor subtype and estrogen response). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tissues representing each microenvironment subtype were performed to evaluate protein expression and compositional differences between microenvironment subtypes.
{RESULTS}: Extratumoral Active versus Inactive subtypes were not significantly associated with overall survival among all patients (hazard ratio ({HR}) = 1.4, 95\% {CI} 0.6 to 2.8, P = 0.337), but there was a strong association with overall survival among estrogen receptor ({ER}) positive patients ({HR} = 2.5, 95\% {CI} 0.9 to 6.7, P = 0.062) and hormone-treated patients ({HR} = 2.6, 95\% {CI} 1.0 to 7.0, P = 0.045). The Active subtype of breast microenvironment is correlated with {TWIST}-overexpression signatures and shares features of claudin-low breast cancers. The Active subtype was also associated with expression of {TGF}-β induced fibroblast activation signatures, but there was no significant association between Active/Inactive microenvironment and desmoid type fibrosis or estrogen response gene expression signatures. Consistent with the {RNA} expression profiles, Active cancer-adjacent tissues exhibited higher density of {TWIST} nuclear staining, predominantly in epithelium, and no evidence of increased fibrosis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results document the presence of two distinct subtypes of microenvironment, with Active versus Inactive cancer-adjacent extratumoral microenvironment influencing the aggressiveness and outcome of {ER}-positive human breast cancers.},

An increase in {MV} number has been found in peripheral blood of patients with several diseases including cancer. We hypothesized that {MV} number and the relative amount of focal adhesion kinase ({FAK}) and epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) proteins in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} are related to the presence of breast cancer.
{METHODS}: Plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} were obtained by differential centrifugation of blood samples. {MV} number was evaluated by {BD} {TruCOUNT} Tubes ({BD} Biosciences). {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins were analyzed by Western blot.
{RESULTS}: {MV} number in plasma fractions enriched with {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} is higher in breast cancer patients with stages I-{IV} as well as with T2-T4 tumors, in comparison to control group. In addition, plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} present {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins and their amount is increased in some stages of breast cancer in comparison to control group.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings strongly suggest that {MV} number and the amount of {FAK} and {EGFR} in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} are associated with some stages of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Expression of the peptide hormones ghrelin and obestatin has previously been demonstrated in human mammary glands. However, the clinical implications of the expression of these peptides in breast cancer are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential clinical value of ghrelin and obestatin as breast cancer biomarkers.


{METHODS}

A tissue microarray containing breast cancer specimens from 144 patients was immunostained with antibodies directed towards ghrelin and obestatin. Using varying cut-offs, the expression of the two peptides was evaluated and correlated to previously known prognostic factors in breast cancer and to the outcome. Cox regression analysis was used to assess whether these markers may predict survival of breast cancer patients.


{RESULTS}

Moderate to strong immunoreactivity for ghrelin and obestatin was observed in 71.5\% and 77.1\% of the cases, respectively. Ghrelin and obestatin expression was significantly but weakly correlated to low histological grade, estrogen receptor positivity, small tumor size and low proliferation. Only ghrelin expression was significantly correlated to better recurrence-free and breast cancer-specific survival ({HR} = 0.3-0.4, p = 0.02-0.05) in both uni- and multivariate analyses. The optimal cut-off was any ghrelin expression versus none. Reproducibility between the two readers was very good for both stainings with kappa values of 0.94-1.00.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Patients with tumors expressing ghrelin had 2.5-3 times lower risk for recurrence or breast cancer death than those lacking ghrelin expression. Ghrelin expression is easily assessable with high reproducibility using immunohistochemistry. Further investigations are needed to establish the clinical significance of ghrelin as a biomarker in breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{DNA} copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) are a hallmark of cancer genomes. However, little is known about how such changes affect global gene expression. We develop a modeling framework, {EPoC} (Endogenous Perturbation analysis of Cancer), to (1) detect disease‐driving {CNAs} and their effect on target {mRNA} expression, and to (2) stratify cancer patients into long‐ and short‐term survivors. Our method constructs causal network models of gene expression by combining genome‐wide {DNA}‐ and {RNA}‐level data. Prognostic scores are obtained from a singular value decomposition of the networks. By applying {EPoC} to glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium, we demonstrate that the resulting network models contain known disease‐relevant hub genes, reveal interesting candidate hubs, and uncover predictors of patient survival. Targeted validations in four glioblastoma cell lines support selected predictions, and implicate the p53‐interacting protein Necdin in suppressing glioblastoma cell growth. We conclude that large‐scale network modeling of the effects of {CNAs} on gene expression may provide insights into the biology of human cancer. Free software in {MATLAB} and R is provided.
Visual Overview
{SynopsisGains} and losses of chromosomal material ({DNA} copy number aberrations; {CNAs}) are a characteristic feature of cancer genomes. At the level of a single locus, it is well known that increased copy number (gene amplification) typically leads to increased gene expression, whereas decreased copy number (gene deletion) leads to decreased gene expression (Pollack et al, 2002; Lee et al, 2008; Nilsson et al, 2008). However, {CNAs} also affect the expression of genes located outside the amplified/deleted region itself via indirect mechanisms. To fully understand the action of {CNAs}, it is therefore necessary to analyze their action in a network context. Toward this goal, improved computational approaches will be important, if not essential.To determine the global effects on transcription of {CNAs} in the brain tumor glioblastoma, we develop {EPoC} (Endogenous Perturbation analysis of Cancer), a computational technique capable of inferring sparse, causal network models by combining genome‐wide, paired {CNA}‐ and {mRNA}‐level data. {EPoC} aims to detect disease‐driving copy number aberrations and their effect on target {mRNA} expression, and stratify patients into long‐term and short‐term survivors. Technically, {EPoC} relates {CNA} perturbations to {mRNA} responses by matrix equations, derived from a steady‐state approximation of the transcriptional network. Patient prognostic scores are obtained from singular value decompositions of the network matrix. The models are constructed by solving a large‐scale, regularized regression problem.We apply {EPoC} to glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) consortium (186 patients). The identified {CNA}‐driven network comprises 10 672 genes, and contains a number of copy number‐altered genes that control multiple downstream genes. Highly connected hub genes include well‐known oncogenes and tumor supressor genes that are frequently deleted or amplified in glioblastoma, including {EGFR}, {PDGFRA}, {CDKN}2A and {CDKN}2B, confirming a clear association between these aberrations and transcriptional variability of these brain tumors. In addition, we identify a number of hub genes that have previously not been associated with glioblastoma, including interferon alpha 1 ({IFNA}1), myeloid/lymphoid or mixed‐lineage leukemia translocated to 10 ({MLLT}10, a well‐known leukemia gene), glutamate decarboxylase 2 {GAD}2, a postulated glutamate receptor {GPR}158 and Necdin ({NDN}). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the network model contains useful information on downstream target genes (including stem cell regulators), and possible drug targets.We proceed to explore the validity of a small network region experimentally. Introducing experimental perturbations of {NDN} and other targets in four glioblastoma cell lines (T98G, U‐87MG, U‐343MG and U‐373MG), we confirm several predicted mechanisms. We also demonstrate that the {TCGA} glioblastoma patients can be stratified into long‐term and short‐term survivors, using our proposed prognostic scores derived from a singular vector decomposition of the network model. Finally, we compare {EPoC} to existing methods for {mRNA} networks analysis and expression quantitative locus methods, and demonstrate that {EPoC} produces more consistent models between technically independent glioblastoma data sets, and that the {EPoC} models exhibit better overlap with known protein–protein interaction networks and pathway maps.In summary, we conclude that large‐scale integrative modeling reveals mechanistically and prognostically informative networks in human glioblastoma. Our approach operates at the gene level and our data support that individual hub genes can be identified in practice. Very large aberrations, however, cannot be fully resolved by the current modeling strategy.
We introduce a modeling approach termed {EPoC} (Endogenous Perturbation analysis of Cancer), enabling the construction of global, gene‐level models that causally connect gene copy number with expression in glioblastoma.On the basis of the resulting model, we predict genes that are likely to be disease‐driving and validate selected predictions experimentally. We also demonstrate that further analysis of the network model by sparse singular value decomposition allows stratification of patients with glioblastoma into short‐term and long‐term survivors, introducing decomposed network models as a useful principle for biomarker discovery.Finally, in systematic comparisons, we demonstrate that {EPoC} is computationally efficient and yields more consistent results than {mRNA}‐only methods, standard {eQTL} methods, and two recent multivariate methods for genotype–{mRNA} coupling.},

To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging ({CS}-{BLI}) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. {CS}-{BLI} is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, {NF}-{kappaB}, {HIF}-1alpha, myc, {hTERT} and {IRF}4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, {CS}-{BLI} can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of {CS}-{BLI}, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The purpose of this study was to characterize the biologic determinants that affect the behavior and management of infiltrating lobular cancer. {METHODS}: A prospectively accrued data base containing 1548 breast cancer cases was queried for specific pathologic and mammographic features. From this data base, 777 patients treated and followed-up at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center were reviewed, and comparisons were made between the following three histologic subgroups: 661 infiltrating ductal ({ID}), 42 infiltrating ductal plus infiltrating lobular ({ID} + {IL}), and 74 infiltrating lobular ({IL}). {RESULTS}: Comparisons of the three histologic forms of breast cancer demonstrated the following: 1. At diagnosis tumors with {IL} components were larger than those with {ID} components (p {\textless} 0.001); in addition, a greater percentage of {IL} cancers were T3 lesions (14.8\%), compared with {ID} cancers (4.5\%). 2. Sizes of {IL} tumors were underestimated frequently by mammographic examinations when compared with pathologic measurements (p {\textless} 0.001). 3. By comparison to {ID} tumors, increasing {IL} tumor size is less likely to be associated with an increased number of metastatic lymph nodes per patient (p = 0.09). 4. Infiltrating lobular cancers treated by lumpectomy with cytologic surgical margin analysis more often gave false-negative results than did {ID} cancers (p {\textless} 0.001). 5. Infiltrating lobular cancers treated by lumpectomy required conversion to mastectomy over 2 times more frequently than {ID} cancers treated by lumpectomy. 6. Mastectomy was performed more frequently than lumpectomy for the treatment of {IL} versus {ID} tumors (p = 0.039). {CONCLUSIONS}: Infiltrating lobular cancers are biologically distinct from {ID} cancers. Although lumpectomy may be performed safely in selected patients, multiple difficulties exist in the management of {IL} cancer, particularly when breast conservation is chosen.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are nanosized (30-100 nm) membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosomes have been found to contain various {RNA} species including {miRNA}, {mRNA} and long non-protein coding {RNAs}. A number of cancer cells produce elevated levels of exosomes. Because exosomes have been isolated from most body fluids they may provide a source for non-invasive cancer diagnostics. Transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies ({RNA}-Seq) offers enormous amount of data that can be used for biomarkers discovery, however, in case of exosomes this approach was applied only for the analysis of small {RNAs}. In this study, we utilized {RNA}-Seq technology to analyze {RNAs} present in microvesicles secreted by human breast cancer cell lines. Exosomes were isolated from the media conditioned by two human breast cancer cell lines, {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {MDA}-{MB}-436. Exosomal {RNA} was profiled using the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based technology. Exosomes were found to contain various classes of {RNA} with the major class represented by fragmented ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}), in particular 28S and 18S {rRNA} subunits. Analysis of exosomal {RNA} content revealed that it reflects {RNA} content of the donor cells. Although exosomes produced by the two cancer cell lines shared most of the {RNA} species, there was a number of non-coding transcripts unique to {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {MDA}-{MB}-436 cells. This suggests that {RNA} analysis might distinguish exosomes produced by low metastatic breast cancer cell line ({MDA}-{MB}-436) from that produced by highly metastatic breast cancer cell line ({MDA}-{MB}-231). The analysis of gene ontologies ({GOs}) associated with the most abundant transcripts present in exosomes revealed significant enrichment in genes encoding proteins involved in translation and {rRNA} and {ncRNA} processing. These {GO} terms indicate most expressed genes for both, cellular and exosomal {RNA}. For the first time, using {RNA}-seq, we examined the transcriptomes of exosomes secreted by human breast cancer cells. We found that most abundant exosomal {RNA} species are the fragments of 28S and 18S {rRNA} subunits. This limits the number of reads from other {RNAs}. To increase the number of detectable transcripts and improve the accuracy of their expression level the protocols allowing depletion of fragmented {rRNA} should be utilized in the future {RNA}-seq analyses on exosomes. Present data revealed that exosomal transcripts are representative of their cells of origin and thus could form basis for detection of tumor specific markers.},

Th in vitro growth pattern morphological and cytogenetic characteristics of these lines maintained continuously for over 2 years are described. The cultures contain a population of mixed cell types that grow in suspension. Between 5 and 10\% of the cells have surface immunoglobulins M and D. B-cell alloantigens are also detectable. While the cultures are predominantly lymphoid, some of the large cells, by light and electron microscopy, resemble the Reed-Sternberg and Hodgkin's cells of the original biopsies. Although the cells maintain the human diploid karyotype, they are heterotransplantable in nude mice. After 14 months of culture, chromosome rearrangement and losses, commonly seen in leukemic bone marrow, occurred. Close to 100\% of the cells are Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen positive, but they lack Epstein-Barr viral ({EBV}) capsid antigen and {EBV}-induced early antigen. Nucleic acid hybridization tests indicated that there were no more than two {EBV} genome equivalents per cell. Tests with {HD} sera free of anti-{EBV} were negative. Electron microscope examination of the cells revealed the presence of intracellular as well as extracellular rare pleomorphic particles ranging from 400 to 1200 A. The nature of these particles, which increased in number after the cultures were treated with halogenated pyrimidines but not with dimethyl sulfoxide, remains questionable. The cultures derived from the mouse-passaged {HD} cells, however, had reverse transcriptase activity and readily identifiable type C particles which were probably of murine origin. These cultures have some unique features that make them useful in studying the perplexing pathological entity of {HD}.},

	abstract = {The expression of {NKX}3.1, a transcriptional regulator and tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer, is downregulated during early stages of prostate tumorigenesis. However, little is known of the alterations in gene expression that occur as a result of this event. We combined laser capture microdissection and gene expression profiling to analyse the molecular consequences of Nkx3.1 loss during prostate cancer initiation using Nkx3.1-deficient mice. This analysis identified a cohort of genes (loss-of-Nkx3.1 signature) that are aberrantly overexpressed during loss-of-Nkx3.1-driven tumor initiation. We studied the expression of these genes in independent loss-of-Pten and c-myc overexpression prostate adenocarcinoma mouse models. Nkx3.1 expression is lost in prostate epithelial proliferation in both of these mouse models. However, Nkx3.1 loss is an early event of tumor development in the loss-of-Pten model, whereas it occurs at later stages in c-myc transgenic mice. A number of genes of the loss-of-Nkx3.1 signature, such as clusterin and quiescin Q6, are highly expressed in prostatic hyperplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia ({PIN}) lesions that also lack Nkx3.1 in the Pten-deficient prostate, but not in similar lesions in the c-myc transgenic model. Meta-analysis of multiple prostate cancer gene expression data sets, including those from loss-of-Nkx3.1, loss-of-Pten, c-myc overexpression and constitutively active Akt prostate cancer models, further confirmed that genes associated with the loss-of-Nkx3.1 signature integrate with {PTEN}-{AKT} signaling pathways, but do not overlap with molecular changes associated with the c-myc signaling pathway. In human prostate tissue samples, loss of {NKX}3.1 expression and corresponding clusterin overexpression are co-localized at sites of prostatic inflammatory atrophy, a possible very early stage of human prostate tumorigenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that the molecular consequences of {NKX}3.1 loss depend on the epithelial proliferative stage at which its expression is lost, and that alterations in the {PTEN}-{AKT}-{NKX}3.1 axis are important for prostate cancer initiation.},

We prospectively looked for predictors of response to these drugs. Experimental design: Four cycles of doxorubicin (75 mg/m²) or docetaxel (100 mg/m²) were compared as presurgical chemotherapy for breast cancer. Biomarkers were determined by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization using prechemotherapy core biopsies. Tumors were also classified into one of the molecular intrinsic subtypes using an immunohistochemical panel of five biomarkers and genomic profiles. Single genes and intrinsic subtypes were correlated with response to doxorubicin versus docetaxel. Among the 204 evaluable patients, significant predictors of sensitivity in multivariate analysis were low topo2a expression and {ER}-negative status for doxorubicin and small tumor size and {ER}-negative status for docetaxel. Predictors of resistance in multivariate analysis were triple-negative status ({ER}/{PgR}/{HER}2 negative by {IHC}/{FISH}) for doxorubicin, and high {TNM} stage for docetaxel. Triple-negative tumors were associated with topo2a overexpression more than the other subtypes. In 94 patients with gene expression profiles, docetaxel was superior to doxorubicin in the basal-like subtype (good pathological response rate - {PCR} + class I of 56 vs. 0\%; P = 0.034); no significant differences were observed in the other subtypes when comparing these two drugs. Low topo2a expression and {ER}-negative status were predictors of response to doxorubicin, while small tumor size and {ER}-negative status predicted response to docetaxel. Docetaxel was superior to doxorubicin in triple-negative/basal-like tumors, while no significant differences were seen in the remaining intrinsic subtypes.},

We aimed to develop a practical molecular assay that can identify subtypes with differential prognosis and response to targeted therapy. Whole-genome expression analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ({FFPE}) material from 55 {ccRCC} patients was performed and two molecular subtypes with differential clinical outcomes were identified by hierarchical clustering. An eight-gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for classification into two subtypes was developed for {FFPE} material. The primary objective was to assess assay performance by correlating {ccRCC} prognostic subtypes to cancer-specific survival ({CSS}) and, for patients receiving targeted therapy, radiologic response. In three validation cohorts, patients could be distinguished into prognostic subtypes with differential {CSS} (Singapore General Hospital {FFPE} cohort: n = 224; p = 1.48 × 10(-8); the Cancer Genome Atlas {RNA}-Sequencing cohort: n = 419; p = 3.06 × 10(-7); Van Andel Research Institute microarray cohort: n=174; p=0.00743). For 48 patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor ({TKI}) treatment, the prognostic classification was associated with radiologic response to treatment (p = 5.96 × 10(-4)) and prolonged survival on {TKI} treatment (p=0.019). The multigene assay can classify {ccRCCs} into clinical prognostic subtypes, which may be predictive of response in patients receiving {TKI} therapy.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Global gene expression analysis of tumor samples has been a valuable tool to subgroup tumors and has the potential to be of prognostic and predictive value. However, tumors are heterogeneous, and homogenates will consist of several different cell types. This study was designed to obtain more refined expression data representing different compartments of the tumor.
{METHODS}: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded stroma-rich triple-negative breast cancer tumors were laser-microdissected, and {RNA} was extracted and processed to enable microarray hybridization. Genes enriched in stroma were identified and used to generate signatures by identifying correlating genes in publicly available data sets. The prognostic implications of the signature were analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Comparison of the expression pattern from stromal and cancer cell compartments from three tumors revealed a number of genes that were essentially specifically expressed in the respective compartments. The stroma-specific genes indicated contribution from fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune/inflammatory cells. The gene set was expanded by identifying correlating {mRNAs} using breast cancer {mRNA} expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By iterative analyses, 16 gene signatures of highly correlating genes were characterized. Based on the gene composition, they seem to represent different cell types. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, two immune/inflammatory signatures had opposing hazard ratios for breast cancer recurrence also after adjusting for clinicopathological variables and molecular subgroup. The signature associated with poor prognosis consisted mainly of C1Q genes and the one associated with good prognosis contained {HLA} genes. This association with prognosis was seen for other cancers as well as in other breast cancer data sets.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our data indicate that the molecular composition of the immune response in a tumor may be a powerful predictor of cancer prognosis.},

A major limitation in this evolving discipline is the hardship and the lack of standardization for already challenging techniques to isolate {EVs}. Technical advances have been accomplished in the field of isolation with improving knowledge and emerging novel technologies including ultracentrifugation, microfluidics, magnetic beads and filtration-based isolation methods. In this review, we will discuss the latest advances in methods regarding isolation methods and production of clinical grade {EVs} as well as their advantages and disadvantages and justification in their support and the challenges that they encounter.},

	abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}) is a heterogeneous disease that includes Basal-like and Claudin-low tumors. The Claudin-low tumors are enriched for features associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ({EMT}) and possibly for tumor initiating cells. Primary {TNBCs} respond relatively well to conventional chemotherapy; however, metastatic disease is virtually incurable. Thus, there is a great interest in identifying specific therapeutic targets for {TNBC}. The tumor suppressor {RB}1 is frequently lost in Basal-like breast cancer. To test for a causative role of {RB}1 gene loss in {BC} and for its effect on specific subtypes, we deleted mouse Rb in mammary stem/bipotent progenitor cells. This led to diverse mammary tumors including {TNBC}, with a subset of the latter containing p53 mutations and exhibiting features of Basal-like {BC} or {EMT}. Combined mutation of Rb and p53 in mammary stem/bipotent progenitors induced {EMT} type tumors. Here, we review our findings and those of others, which connect Rb and p53 to {EMT} in {TNBC}. Furthermore, we discuss how by understanding this circuit and its vulnerabilities, we may identify novel therapy for {TNBC}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis ({MCIA}), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, {MCIA} simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using {MCIA}, applied to two typical "omics" research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the {NCI}-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation {RNA}-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of {RNA}-sequencing data processed using {RPKM} had greater variance than that with {MapSplice} and {RSEM}. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. {MCIA} is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor "omicade4" package.
{CONCLUSION}: We believe {MCIA} is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. {MCIA} provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

Despite the loss of p53, {BRCA}1-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cisplatin, and patients with {BRCA}1-associated ovarian carcinomas experience improved outcomes with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with sporadic cases. Although it is known that chemosensitivity in {BRCA}1-associated cancers is associated with unrepaired {DNA} damage, the specific effector pathway mediating the cellular response to platinum-induced damage in these tumors is poorly understood. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73, encoding a proapoptotic protein that is linked to chemosensitivity in many settings, is upregulated through a novel epigenetic mechanism in both human and murine models of {BRCA}1-associated ovarian carcinoma. {BRCA}1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor {ZEB}1, leading to the abrogation of {ZEB}1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms ({TAp}73). Cisplatin chemotherapy induces {TAp}73 target genes specifically in {BRCA}1-deficient cells, and knockdown of {TAp}73 in these cells causes chemoresistance while having little or no effect on {BRCA}1-expressing tumor cells. In primary ovarian carcinomas, {ZEB}1 binding site methylation and {TAp}73 expression correlate with {BRCA}1 status and with clinical response. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism that supports the contribution of {TAp}73 as an important mediator of the response to platinum chemotherapy in a subset of ovarian carcinomas. {TAp}73 might represent a response predictor and potential therapeutic target for enhancing chemosensitivity in this disease.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Six gene expression subtypes of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer were recently defined using microarrays by Tothill and colleagues. The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) project subsequently replicated these subtypes and identified a signature predictive of survival in high-grade serous ({HGS}) cancers. We previously validated these signatures for use in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The aim of the present study was to determine whether these signatures are associated with specific ovarian cancer risk factors, which would add to the evidence that they reflect the heterogeneous etiology of this disease.
{METHODS}: We modeled signature-specific tumor characteristics and epidemiologic risk factor relationships using multiple regression and multivariate response multiple regression models in 193 patients from a case-control study of epithelial ovarian cancer.
{RESULTS}: We observed associations between the Tothill gene expression subtype signatures and both age at diagnosis (P = 0.0008) and race (P = 0.008). Although most established epidemiologic risk factors were not associated with molecular signatures, there was an association between breast feeding (P = 0.024) and first-degree family history of breast or ovarian cancer (P = 0.034) among the 106 {HGS} cases. Some of the above associations were validated using gene expression microarray data from the {TCGA} project. Weak associations were seen with age at menarche and duration of oral contraceptive use and the {TCGA} survival signature.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data support the potential for genomic characterization to elucidate the etiologic heterogeneity of epithelial ovarian cancer.
{IMPACT}: This study suggests that molecular signatures may augment the ability to define etiologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Perturbations in cell-cell interactions are a key feature of cancer. However, little is known about the systematic effects of cell-cell interaction on global gene expression in cancer.


{RESULTS}

We used an ex vivo model to simulate tumor-stroma interaction by systematically co-cultivating breast cancer cells with stromal fibroblasts and determined associated gene expression changes with {cDNA} microarrays. In the complex picture of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction effects, a prominent characteristic was an induction of interferon-response genes ({IRGs}) in a subset of cancer cells. In close proximity to these cancer cells, the fibroblasts secreted type I interferons, which, in turn, induced expression of the {IRGs} in the tumor cells. Paralleling this model, immunohistochemical analysis of human breast cancer tissues showed that {STAT}1, the key transcriptional activator of the {IRGs}, and itself an {IRG}, was expressed in a subset of the cancers, with a striking pattern of elevated expression in the cancer cells in close proximity to the stroma. In vivo, expression of the {IRGs} was remarkably coherent, providing a basis for segregation of 295 early-stage breast cancers into two groups. Tumors with high compared to low expression levels of {IRGs} were associated with significantly shorter overall survival; 59\% versus 80\% at 10 years (log-rank p = 0.001).


{CONCLUSION}

In an effort to deconvolute global gene expression profiles of breast cancer by systematic characterization of heterotypic interaction effects in vitro, we found that an interaction between some breast cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts can induce an interferon-response, and that this response may be associated with a greater propensity for tumor progression.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Exosomes, endosome-derived membrane microvesicles, contain specific {RNA} transcripts that are thought to be involved in cell-cell communication. These {RNA} transcripts have great potential as disease biomarkers. To characterize exosomal {RNA} profiles systemically, we performed {RNA} sequencing analysis using three human plasma samples and evaluated the efficacies of small {RNA} library preparation protocols from three manufacturers. In all we evaluated 14 libraries (7 replicates).
{RESULTS}: From the 14 size-selected sequencing libraries, we obtained a total of 101.8 million raw single-end reads, an average of about 7.27 million reads per library. Sequence analysis showed that there was a diverse collection of the exosomal {RNA} species among which {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) were the most abundant, making up over 42.32\% of all raw reads and 76.20\% of all mappable reads. At the current read depth, 593 {miRNAs} were detectable. The five most common {miRNAs} ({miR}-99a-5p, {miR}-128, {miR}-124-3p, {miR}-22-3p, and {miR}-99b-5p) collectively accounted for 48.99\% of all mappable {miRNA} sequences. {MiRNA} target gene enrichment analysis suggested that the highly abundant {miRNAs} may play an important role in biological functions such as protein phosphorylation, {RNA} splicing, chromosomal abnormality, and angiogenesis. From the unknown {RNA} sequences, we predicted 185 potential {miRNA} candidates. Furthermore, we detected significant fractions of other {RNA} species including ribosomal {RNA} (9.16\% of all mappable counts), long non-coding {RNA} (3.36\%), piwi-interacting {RNA} (1.31\%), transfer {RNA} (1.24\%), small nuclear {RNA} (0.18\%), and small nucleolar {RNA} (0.01\%); fragments of coding sequence (1.36\%), 5' untranslated region (0.21\%), and 3' untranslated region (0.54\%) were also present. In addition to the {RNA} composition of the libraries, we found that the three tested commercial kits generated a sufficient number of {DNA} fragments for sequencing but each had significant bias toward capturing specific {RNAs}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study demonstrated that a wide variety of {RNA} species are embedded in the circulating vesicles. To our knowledge, this is the first report that applied deep sequencing to discover and characterize profiles of plasma-derived exosomal {RNAs}. Further characterization of these extracellular {RNAs} in diverse human populations will provide reference profiles and open new doors for the development of blood-based biomarkers for human diseases.},

{RESULTS}: {RNA} profiles showed that ribosomal {RNA} was primary detectable in apoptotic bodies and smaller {RNAs} without prominent ribosomal {RNA} peaks in exosomes. In contrast, microvesicles contained little or no {RNA} except for microvesicles collected from {TF}-1 cell cultures. The different vesicle pellets showed highly different distribution of size, shape and electron density with typical apoptotic body, microvesicle and exosome characteristics when analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Flow cytometry revealed the presence of {CD}63 and {CD}81 in all vesicles investigated, as well as {CD}9 except in the {TF}-1-derived vesicles, as these cells do not express {CD}9.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results demonstrate that centrifugation-based protocols are simple and fast systems to distinguish subpopulations of extracellular vesicles. Different vesicles show different {RNA} profiles and morphological characteristics, but they are indistinguishable using {CD}63-coated beads for flow cytometry analysis.},

However, {BRCA}1 dysfunction is frequently present in these malignancies, compromising homology-directed {DNA} repair. This defect may serve as the tumor's Achilles heel and make the tumor hypersensitive to {DNA} breaks. We have evaluated this putative synthetic lethality in a genetically engineered mouse model for {BRCA}1-associated breast cancer, using the topoisomerase I (Top1) poison topotecan as monotherapy and in combination with poly({ADP}-ribose) polymerase inhibition by olaparib. All 20 tumors tested were topotecan sensitive, but response heterogeneity was substantial. Although topotecan increased mouse survival, all tumors eventually acquired resistance. As mechanisms of in vivo resistance, we identified overexpression of Abcg2/Bcrp and markedly reduced protein levels of the drug target Top1 (without altered {mRNA} levels). Tumor-specific genetic ablation of Abcg2 significantly increased overall survival of topotecan-treated animals (P {\textless} 0.001), confirming the in vivo relevance of {ABCG}2 for topotecan resistance in a novel approach. Despite the lack of {ABCG}2, a putative tumor-initiating cell marker, none of the 11 Abcg2(-/-);Brca1(-/-);p53(-/-) tumors were eradicated, not even by the combination topotecan-olaparib. We find that olaparib substantially increases topotecan toxicity in this model, and we suggest that this might also happen in humans.},

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 114 patients with stage I-{IV} {CRC} who underwent primary tumor resection. Quantitative real-time {PCR} and immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) assays were performed in samples obtained from the primary tumors. The correlation between the expression of these markers and the expression of p53, Bcl-2, Ki67, epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) and vascular endothelial growth factor was assessed with the Spearman coefficient (r). Results: The {ITGAV} gene was found to be significantly amplified in tumors with positive perineural invasion (p = 0.028).

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0028072},
	abstract = {The number of high-dimensional datasets recording multiple aspects of a single phenomenon is increasing in many areas of science, accompanied by a need for mathematical frameworks that can compare multiple large-scale matrices with different row dimensions. The only such framework to date, the generalized singular value decomposition ({GSVD}), is limited to two matrices. We mathematically define a higher-order {GSVD} ({HO} {GSVD}) for N≥2 matrices D(i)∈R(m(i) × n), each with full column rank. Each matrix is exactly factored as D(i)=U(i)Σ(i)V(T), where V, identical in all factorizations, is obtained from the eigensystem {SV}={VΛ} of the arithmetic mean S of all pairwise quotients A(i)A(j)(-1) of the matrices A(i)=D(i)(T)D(i), i≠j. We prove that this decomposition extends to higher orders almost all of the mathematical properties of the {GSVD}. The matrix S is nondefective with V and Λ real. Its eigenvalues satisfy λ(k)≥1. Equality holds if and only if the corresponding eigenvector v(k) is a right basis vector of equal significance in all matrices D(i) and D(j), that is σ(i,k)/σ(j,k)=1 for all i and j, and the corresponding left basis vector u(i,k) is orthogonal to all other vectors in U(i) for all i. The eigenvalues λ(k)=1, therefore, define the "common {HO} {GSVD} subspace." We illustrate the {HO} {GSVD} with a comparison of genome-scale cell-cycle {mRNA} expression from S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and human. Unlike existing algorithms, a mapping among the genes of these disparate organisms is not required. We find that the approximately common {HO} {GSVD} subspace represents the cell-cycle {mRNA} expression oscillations, which are similar among the datasets. Simultaneous reconstruction in the common subspace, therefore, removes the experimental artifacts, which are dissimilar, from the datasets. In the simultaneous sequence-independent classification of the genes of the three organisms in this common subspace, genes of highly conserved sequences but significantly different cell-cycle peak times are correctly classified.},

	abstract = {Protein interaction networks play central roles in biological systems, from simple metabolic pathways through complex programs permitting the development of organisms. Multicellularity could only have arisen from a careful orchestration of cellular and molecular roles and responsibilities, all properly controlled and regulated. Disease reflects a breakdown of this organismal homeostasis. To better understand the evolution of interactions whose dysfunction may be contributing factors to disease, we derived the human protein coevolution network using our {MatrixMatchMaker} algorithm and using the Orthologous {MAtrix} project ({OMA}) database as a source for protein orthologs from 103 eukaryotic genomes. We annotated the coevolution network using protein-protein interaction data, many functional data sources, and we explored the evolutionary rates and dates of emergence of the proteins in our data set. Strikingly, clustering based only on the topology of the coevolution network partitions it into two subnetworks, one generally representing ancient eukaryotic functions and the other functions more recently acquired during animal evolution. That latter subnetwork is enriched for proteins with roles in cell-cell communication, the control of cell division, and related multicellular functions. Further annotation using data from genetic disease databases and cancer genome sequences strongly implicates these proteins in both ciliopathies and cancer. The enrichment for such disease markers in the animal network suggests a functional link between these coevolving proteins. Genetic validation corroborates the recruitment of ancient cilia in the evolution of multicellularity.},

A failure to find cancer is not definitive in a significant percentage of patients due to the presence of equivocal structures or continuing clinical suspicion. We have identified gene expression changes in stroma that can detect tumor nearby. We compared gene expression profiles of 13 biopsies containing stroma near tumor and 15 biopsies from volunteers without prostate cancer. About 3,800 significant expression changes were found and thereafter filtered using independent expression profiles to eliminate possible age-related genes and genes expressed at detectable levels in tumor cells. A stroma-specific classifier for nearby tumor was constructed on the basis of 114 candidate genes and tested on 364 independent samples including 243 tumor-bearing samples and 121 nontumor samples (normal biopsies, normal autopsies, remote stroma, as well as stroma within a few millimeters of tumor). The classifier predicted the tumor status of patients using tumor-free samples with an average accuracy of 97\% (sensitivity = 98\% and specificity = 88\%) whereas classifiers trained with sets of 100 randomly generated genes had no diagnostic value. These results indicate that the prostate cancer microenvironment exhibits reproducible changes useful for categorizing the presence of tumor in patients when a prostate sample is derived from near the tumor but does not contain any recognizable tumor.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: Advanced renal cell carcinoma ({RCC}) remains a largely incurable disease with a grave prognosis despite the availability of a multiplicity of systemic therapies targeted against vascular endothelial growth factor, its receptors, and the mammalian target of rapamycin. Although immune 'checkpoint inhibitors' appear to have activity in clear cell {RCC} based on recent early phase trials, the true magnitude of the benefit conferred by these agents remains to be fully understood. Given the limitations of existing treatment paradigms, ongoing research into new targetable pathways is critical. This review will highlight some of the more promising avenues of investigation into the molecular biology of {RCC}.
{RECENT} {FINDINGS}: The hypoxia-inducible factor and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways remain critical targets in clear cell {RCC}. In addition, genes involved in chromatin remodeling such as polybromo 1 ({PBRM}1), {SET} domain containing 2 ({SETD}2), and {BRCA}-1-associated protein-1 ({BAP}1) have been shown to influence tumor biology and predict survival. {MET} alterations and the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase are associated with familial type 1 and type 2 papillary {RCC} ({PRCC}), respectively. Alterations in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, Kelch-like erythroid-derived cap-n-collar homology-associated protein 1, and cullin 3, components of an oxidative stress response pathway, have been recently recognized in some sporadic papillary tumors as well as in fumarate hydratase-deficient tumor and may serve as additional therapeutic targets. In addition, whole-genome sequencing and integrated genomic analysis strategies are beginning to uncover unique molecular signatures associated with distinct subtypes of {RCC}, laying the foundation for a molecular classification of {RCC} and more precise, mechanism-based therapeutic intervention.
{SUMMARY}: The complex molecular changes underlying individual {RCC} variants are yet to be fully elucidated and remain the subject of ongoing investigation. The findings summarized here further exemplify the diversity of {RCC} and the need to tailor our therapeutic approaches to the unique genetic alterations specific to individual subtypes of {RCC}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis ({MCIA}), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, {MCIA} simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using {MCIA}, applied to two typical "omics" research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the {NCI}-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation {RNA}-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of {RNA}-sequencing data processed using {RPKM} had greater variance than that with {MapSplice} and {RSEM}. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. {MCIA} is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor "omicade4" package.
{CONCLUSION}: We believe {MCIA} is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. {MCIA} provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Until recently, few molecular aberrations were recognized in acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T-cell origin; novel lesions have recently been identified and a certain degree of overlap between acute myeloid leukemia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been suggested. To identify novel T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia entities, gene expression profiling was performed and clinico-biological features were studied.
{DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Sixty-nine untreated adults with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were evaluated by oligonucleotide arrays: unsupervised and supervised analyses were performed. The up-regulation of myeloid genes and {miR}-223 expression were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis.
{RESULTS}: Using unsupervised clustering, we identified five subgroups. Of these, one branch included seven patients whose gene expression profile resembled that of acute myeloid leukemia. These cases were characterized by over-expression of a large set of myeloid-related genes for surface antigens, transcription factors and granule proteins. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed over-expression of {MPO}, {CEBPA}, {CEBPB}, {GRN} and {IL}8. We, therefore, evaluated the expression levels of {miR}-223, involved in myeloid differentiation: these cases had significantly higher levels of {miR}-223 than had the other cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with values comparable to those observed in acute myeloid leukemia. Finally, these patients appear to have an unfavorable clinical course.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Using gene profiling we identified a subset of adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, accounting for 10\% of the cases analyzed, which displays myeloid features. These cases were not recognized by standard approaches, underlining the importance of gene profiling in identifying novel acute leukemia subsets. The recognition of this subgroup may have clinical, prognostic and therapeutic implications.},

We define and prove the mathematical properties of a novel tensor generalized singular value decomposition ({GSVD}), which can simultaneously find the similarities and dissimilarities, i.e., patterns of varying relative significance, between any two such tensors. We demonstrate the tensor {GSVD} in comparative modeling of patient- and platform-matched but probe-independent ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma ({OV}) tumor, mostly high-grade, and normal {DNA} copy-number profiles, across each chromosome arm, and combination of two arms, separately. The modeling uncovers previously unrecognized patterns of tumor-exclusive platform-consistent co-occurring copy-number alterations ({CNAs}). We find, first, and validate that each of the patterns across only 7p and Xq, and the combination of 6p+12p, is correlated with a patient's prognosis, is independent of the tumor's stage, the best predictor of {OV} survival to date, and together with stage makes a better predictor than stage alone. Second, these patterns include most known {OV}-associated {CNAs} that map to these chromosome arms, as well as several previously unreported, yet frequent focal {CNAs}. Third, differential {mRNA}, {microRNA}, and protein expression consistently map to the {DNA} {CNAs}. A coherent picture emerges for each pattern, suggesting roles for the {CNAs} in {OV} pathogenesis and personalized therapy.

Subsequently, subpopulations from these morphological responses were identified through consensus clustering to reveal three clusters of round, grape-like, and stellate phenotypes. In some cases, cell lines with particular pathobiological phenotypes clustered together (e.g., {ERBB}2 amplified cell lines sharing the same morphometric properties as the grape-like phenotype). Next, associations with molecular features were realized through (i) differential analysis within each morphological cluster, and (ii) regression analysis across the entire panel of cell lines. In both cases, the dominant genes that are predictive of the morphological signatures were identified. Specifically, {PPARgamma} has been associated with the invasive stellate morphological phenotype, which corresponds to triple-negative pathobiology. {PPARgamma} has been validated through two supporting biological assays.},

Second, all the normalized data tables are aggregated into a grand data table that is analyzed via a (non-normalized) {PCA} that gives a set of factor scores for the observations and loadings for the variables. In addition, {MFA} provides for each data table a set of partial factor scores for the observations that reflects the specific ‘view-point’ of this data table.

Here, we provide the first evidence of increased hypothalamic signaling via {GSK}3b in leptin-deficient Lepob/ob mice and show that intracerebroventricular injection of a {GSK}3b inhibitor acutely improves glucose tolerance in these mice. The beneficial effect of the {GSK}3b inhibitor was dependent on hypothalamic signaling via phosphatidylinositol 3-{OH} kinase ({PI}3K), a key intracellular mediator of both leptin and insulin action. Conversely, neuron-specific over-expression of {GSK}3b in the mediobasal hypothalamus exacerbated the hyperphagia, obesity and impairment of glucose tolerance induced by a high-fat diet, while having had little effect in controls fed standard chow. These results demonstrate that increased hypothalamic {GSK}3b signaling contributes to deleterious effects of leptin deficiency and exacerbates high-fat diet-induced weight gain and glucose intolerance.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of gene expression-based classification along with established prognostic markers and mutation status of the {TP}53 gene (tumour protein p53) in a group of breast cancer patients with long-term (12 to 16 years) follow-up. {METHODS} The clinical and histopathological parameters of 200 breast cancer patients were studied for their effects on clinical outcome using univariate/multivariate Cox regression. The prognostic impact of mutations in the {TP}53 gene, identified using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing, was also evaluated. Eighty of the samples were analyzed for gene expression using 42 K {cDNA} microarrays and the patients were assigned to five previously defined molecular expression groups. The strength of the gene expression based classification versus standard markers was evaluated by adding this variable to the Cox regression model used to analyze all samples. {RESULTS} Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that {TP}53 mutation status, tumor size and lymph node status were the strongest predictors of breast cancer survival for the whole group of patients. Analyses of the patients with gene expression data showed that {TP}53 mutation status, gene expression based classification, tumor size and lymph node status were significant predictors of survival. Breast cancer cases in the 'basal-like' and '{ERBB}2+' gene expression subgroups had a very high mortality the first two years, while the 'highly proliferating luminal' cases developed the disease more slowly, showing highest mortality after 5 to 8 years. The {TP}53 mutation status showed strong association with the 'basal-like' and '{ERBB}2+' subgroups, and tumors with mutation had a characteristic gene expression pattern. {CONCLUSION} {TP}53 mutation status and gene-expression based groups are important survival markers of breast cancer, and these molecular markers may provide prognostic information that complements clinical variables. The study adds experience and knowledge to an ongoing characterization and classification of the disease.},

	abstract = {Untargeted metabolic profiling has become a common approach to attempt to understand biological systems. However, due to the large chemical diversity in the metabolites it is generally necessary to employ multiple analytical platforms so as to encompass a wide range of metabolites. Thus it is beneficial to find chemometrics approaches which can effectively integrate data generated from multiple platforms and ideally combine the strength of each platform and overcome their inherent weaknesses; most pertinent is with respect to limited chemistries. We have reported a few studies using untargeted metabolic profiling techniques to monitor the natural spoilage process in pork and also to detect specific metabolites associated with contaminations with the pathogen Salmonella typhimurium . One method used was to analyse the volatile organic compounds ({VoCs}) generated throughout the spoilage process while the other was to analyse the soluble small molecule metabolites ({SMM}) extracted from the microbial community, as well as from the surface of the spoiled/contaminated meat. In this study, we exploit multi-block principal component analysis ({MB}-{PCA}) and multi-block partial least squares ({MB}-{PLS}) to combine the {VoCs} and {SMM} data together and compare the results obtained by analysing each data set individually. We show that by combining the two data sets and applying appropriate chemometrics, a model with much better prediction and importantly with improved interpretability was obtained. The {MB}-{PCA} model was able to combine the strength of both platforms together and generated a model with high consistency with the biological expectations, despite its unsupervised nature. {MB}-{PLS} models also achieved the best over-all performance in modelling the spoilage progression and discriminating the naturally spoiled samples and the pathogen contaminated samples. Correlation analysis and Bayesian network analysis were also performed to elucidate which metabolites were correlated strongly in the two data sets and such information could add additional information in understanding the meat spoilage process.},

Several excellent software tools for navigating the gene ontology have been developed. However, no existing system provides an interactively expandable graph-based view of the gene ontology hierarchy. Furthermore, most existing tools are web-based or require an Internet connection, will not load local annotations files, and provide either analysis or visualization functionality, but not both. {RESULTS}: To address the above limitations, we have developed {GOLEM} (Gene Ontology Local Exploration Map), a visualization and analysis tool for focused exploration of the gene ontology graph. {GOLEM} allows the user to dynamically expand and focus the local graph structure of the gene ontology hierarchy in the neighborhood of any chosen term. It also supports rapid analysis of an input list of genes to find enriched gene ontology terms. The {GOLEM} application permits the user either to utilize local gene ontology and annotations files in the absence of an Internet connection, or to access the most recent ontology and annotation information from the gene ontology webpage. {GOLEM} supports global and organism-specific searches by gene ontology term name, gene ontology id and gene name. {CONCLUSION}: {GOLEM} is a useful software tool for biologists interested in visualizing the local directed acyclic graph structure of the gene ontology hierarchy and searching for gene ontology terms enriched in genes of interest.

The primary cytotoxic effect of many chemotherapy drugs is mediated by apoptotic response in tumor cells.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Tumours contain hypoxic regions that select for an aggressive cell phenotype; tumour hypoxia induces metastasis-associated genes. Treatment refractory patients with metastatic cancer show increased numbers of circulating tumour cells ({CTCs}), which are also associated with disease progression. The aim of this study was to examine the as yet unknown relationship between hypoxia and {CTCs}.


{METHODS}

We generated human {MDA}-{MB}-231 orthotopic xenografts and, using a new technology, isolated viable human {CTCs} from murine blood. The {CTCs} and parental {MDA}-{MB}-231 cells were incubated at 21 and 0.2\% (hypoxia) oxygen, respectively. Colony formation was assayed and levels of hypoxia- and anoxia-inducible factors were measured. Xenografts generated from {CTCs} and parental cells were compared.


{RESULTS}

{MDA}-{MB}-231 xenografts used to generate {CTCs} were hypoxic, expressing hypoxia factors: hypoxia-inducible factor1 alpha ({HIF}1alpha) and glucose transporter protein type 1 ({GLUT}1), and anoxia-induced factors: activating transcription factor 3 and 4 ({ATF}3 and {ATF}4). Parental {MDA}-{MB}-231 cells induced {ATF}3 in hypoxia, whereas {CTCs} expressed it constitutively. Asparagine synthetase ({ASNS}) expression was also higher in {CTCs}. Hypoxia induced {ATF}4 and the {HIF}1alpha target gene apelin in {CTCs}, but not in parental cells. Hypoxia induced lower levels of carbonic anhydrase {IX} ({CAIX}), {GLUT}1 and {BCL}2/adenovirus E1B 19-{KD} protein-interacting protein 3 ({BNIP}3) proteins in {CTCs} than in parental cells, supporting an altered hypoxia response. In chronic hypoxia, {CTCs} demonstrated greater colony formation than parental cells. Xenografts generated from {CTCs} were larger and heavier, and metastasised faster than {MDA}-{MB}-231 xenografts.


{CONCLUSION}

{CTCs} show an altered hypoxia response and an enhanced aggressive phenotype in vitro and in vivo.},

We sought to identify relationships between tissue composition, risk factors, tumor characteristics, and gene expression. Methods: Participants were 146 patients from the Polish Breast Cancer Study, with data on risk factor and clinicopathological characteristics. Benign breast tissue composition was evaluated using digital image analysis of histological sections. Whole genome microarrays were performed on the same tissue blocks. Results: Mean epithelial, non-fatty stromal, and adipose proportions were 8.4\% ({SD}=4.9\%), 27.7\% ({SD}=24.0\%), and 64.0\% ({SD}=24.0\%), respectively. Among women {\textless} 50 years old, stroma proportion decreased and adipose proportion increased with age, with approximately 2\% difference per year (p {\textless}0.01). The variation in epithelial proportion with age was modest (0.1\% per year). Higher epithelial proportion was associated with obesity (7.6\% in non-obese vs 10.1\% in obese; p=0.02) and with poorly differentiated tumors (7.8\% in well/moderate vs 9.9\% in poor; p=0.05). Gene expression signatures associated with epithelial and stromal proportion were identified and validated. Stroma-associated genes were in metabolism and stem cell maintenance pathways, while epithelial genes were enriched for cytokine and immune response pathways. Conclusions: Breast tissue composition was associated with age, {BMI}, and tumor grade, with consequences for breast gene expression. Impact:Breast tissue morphologic factors may influence breast cancer etiology. Composition and gene expression may act as biomarkers of breast cancer risk and progression.},

The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible {GSE} methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.
{RESULTS}: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis ({GSVA}), a {GSE} method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of {GSVA} in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how {GSVA} works analogously with data from both microarray and {RNA}-seq experiments.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {GSVA} provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While {GSE} methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, {GSVA} constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, {GSVA} contributes to the current need of {GSE} methods for {RNA}-seq data. {GSVA} is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

The developmental mechanisms of breast neuroendocrine carcinoma (B-{NEC}) have not been sufficiently analysed and are not well understood.


{AIMS}

To investigate {NE} cells in the background tissues surrounding B-{NECs}.


{METHODS}

Three cases (four breasts) having many {NE} cells in the background tissues of multifocal B-{NECs} were identified at the University of Yamanashi Hospital and St Luke's International Hospital, Japan. These patients were, respectively, 28-, 31- and 38-year-old women with no familial history of {NE} tumour. The totally-resected breasts were serially studied by immunohistochemistry for specific {NE} markers (chromogranin A/synaptophysin) and the morphologies and/or localisation of {NE} cells were investigated.


{RESULTS}

Immunohistochemical examination showed extensively-distributed {NE} cells in the background mammary ducts/lobules of the {NECs} in all breasts. These {NE} cells were classifiable into three emerging patterns: isolated/scattered, clustered and circumferential. Their distributions were intermingled and were not clearly related to B-{NEC} foci. {NE} cells were morphologically polygonal, oval or columnar with sometimes eosinophilic and/or fine-granular cytoplasm and round-to-ovoid nuclei lacking atypia. Some cells were located between epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Apical snouts were occasionally observed in {NE} cells forming luminal structures.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Benign-appearing {NE} cells in the parenchyma of a breast with {NEC} could be regarded as hyperplastic from their emerging patterns and distribution; this {NE} cell hyperplasia may be associated with the histogenesis of B-{NEC} as a precancerous condition. These observations might raise questions about the treatment for B-{NEC}.},

High-throughput copy number and gene expression data of 36 microsatellite stable sporadic colon cancers resected from patients of a single institution characterized for mutations in {APC}, {KRAS}, {TP}53 and loss of 18q were analyzed. Genes whose expression correlated with the underlying copy number pattern were selected, and their association with the above listed mutations and overall survival was evaluated.

New candidate genes with a potential role in colon cancer are {PLCG}1 on 20q, {DBC}1 on 8q21, and {NDGR}1 on 8p24. In addition, an unexpected pattern of loss and mutability was found in the region upstream of the {KRAS} gene.

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in ∼40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by {CNAs}, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in {PPP}2R2A, {MTAP} and {MAP}2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired {DNA}-{RNA} profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the '{CNA}-devoid' subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic {CNAs} on the transcriptome.},

Breast cancer cells arriving at bone tissues mount supportive microenvironment by recruiting and modulating the activity of several host tissue cell types including the specialized bone cells osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Pathologically activated osteoclasts produce osteolytic lesions associated with bone pain, pathological fractures, cord compression and other complications of metastatic breast carcinoma at bone. Over the last decade there has been enormous growth of knowledge in the field of osteoclasts biology both in the physiological state and in the tumor microenvironment. This knowledge allowed the development and implementation of several targeted therapeutics that expanded the armamentarium of the oncologists dealing with the metastases-associated osteolytic disease. While the interactions of cancer cells with resident bone cells at the established metastatic gross lesions are well-studied, the preclinical events that underlie the progression of disseminated tumor cells into micrometastases and then into clinically-overt macrometastases are just starting to be uncovered. In this review, we discuss the established information and the most recent discoveries in the pathogenesis of osteolytic metastases of breast cancer, as well as the corresponding investigational drugs that have been introduced into clinical development.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Single sample predictors ({SSPs}) and Subtype classification models ({SCMs}) are gene expression-based classifiers used to identify the four primary molecular subtypes of breast cancer (basal-like, {HER}2-enriched, luminal A, and luminal B). {SSPs} use hierarchical clustering, followed by nearest centroid classification, based on large sets of tumor-intrinsic genes. {SCMs} use a mixture of Gaussian distributions based on sets of genes with expression specifically correlated with three key breast cancer genes (estrogen receptor [{ER}], {HER}2, and aurora kinase A [{AURKA}]). The aim of this study was to compare the robustness, classification concordance, and prognostic value of these classifiers with those of a simplified three-gene {SCM} in a large compendium of microarray datasets.


{METHODS}

Thirty-six publicly available breast cancer datasets (n = 5715) were subjected to molecular subtyping using five published classifiers (three {SSPs} and two {SCMs}) and {SCMGENE}, the new three-gene ({ER}, {HER}2, and {AURKA}) {SCM}. We used the prediction strength statistic to estimate robustness of the classification models, defined as the capacity of a classifier to assign the same tumors to the same subtypes independently of the dataset used to fit it. We used Cohen κ and Cramer V coefficients to assess concordance between the subtype classifiers and association with clinical variables, respectively. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and cross-validated partial likelihood to compare prognostic value of the resulting classifications. All statistical tests were two-sided.


{RESULTS}

{SCMs} were statistically significantly more robust than {SSPs}, with {SCMGENE} being the most robust because of its simplicity. {SCMGENE} was statistically significantly concordant with published {SCMs} (κ = 0.65-0.70) and {SSPs} (κ = 0.34-0.59), statistically significantly associated with {ER} (V = 0.64), {HER}2 (V = 0.52) status, and histological grade (V = 0.55), and yielded similar strong prognostic value.


{CONCLUSION}

Our results suggest that adequate classification of the major and clinically relevant molecular subtypes of breast cancer can be robustly achieved with quantitative measurements of three key genes.},

The main outcome was measured on a Visual Analogue Scale ({VAS}) from 0 (enjoyed it not at all) to 100 (enjoyed it very much). A total of 103 tastings were recorded (42 in Ireland, 61 elsewhere) in 71 different pubs spread over 33 cities and 14 countries. The enjoyment of Guinness consumed in Ireland was rated higher (74 mm {VAS}) than outside Ireland (57 mm; P {\textless} 0.001). This difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for researcher, pub ambience, Guinness appearance, and the sensory measures mouthfeel, flavor, and aftertaste. This study is the first to provide scientific evidence that Guinness does not travel well and that the enjoyment of Guinness (for our group of nonexpert tasters) was higher when in Ireland. Results, however, are subject to further verification because of limitations in the study design.},

In this note, we introduce an efficient pipeline: {DeconRNASeq}, an R package for deconvolution of heterogeneous tissues based on {mRNA}-Seq data. It adopts a globally optimized non-negative decomposition algorithm through quadratic programming for estimating the mixing proportions of distinctive tissue types in next-generation sequencing data. We demonstrated the feasibility and validity of {DeconRNASeq} across a range of mixing levels and sources using {mRNA}-Seq data mixed in silico at known concentrations. We validated our computational approach for various benchmark data, with high correlation between our predicted cell proportions and the real fractions of tissues. Our study provides a rigorous, quantitative and high-resolution tool as a prerequisite to use {mRNA}-Seq data. The modularity of package design allows an easy deployment of custom analytical pipelines for data from other high-throughput platforms.

The selection of these origins of replication is a dynamic process responding to both developmental and tissue-specific signals. In this review, we explore the role of the local chromatin environment in regulating the {DNA} replication program at the level of origin selection and activation.

However, {ILC} genomic signature was characterised by significantly more frequent losses of 13q21.33–q31.3 region (46.5\%) and 22q11.23–q12.1 region (50\%) whereas {IDC} showed significantly more frequent losses of 11q23.1–q23.2 region (in 44\% of {IDC}). Nine different regions of high level amplifications were found in 38\% of {ILC} (8/21 cases). Localised on chromosome 11 (11q13.2 region), the most frequent region of amplification encompassing the {CCND}1 and {FGF}3 genes was observed in five different {ILC}. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of transcriptomic data showed that {ILC} and {IDC} clustered apart. Genes involved in cell adhesion, cell communication and trafficking, extra cellular matrix-interaction pathways or cell mobility contributed to this clustering. Despite these differences, the overall clinical outcome of {ILC} was identical to that of {IDC}. This molecular study highlights that lobular and oestrogens-positive ductal invasive carcinomas share common genomic alterations but that {ILC} present some specific molecular alterations. These molecular specificities should help with the identification of new therapeutic targets for {ILC} patients.},

	abstract = {Due to the large number of putative {microRNA} gene targets predicted by sequence-alignment databases and the relative low accuracy of such predictions which are conducted independently of biological context by design, systematic experimental identification and validation of every functional {microRNA} target is currently challenging. Consequently, biological studies have yet to identify, on a genome scale, key regulatory networks perturbed by altered {microRNA} functions in the context of cancer. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time how phenotypic knowledge of inheritable cancer traits and of risk factor loci can be utilized jointly with gene expression analysis to efficiently prioritize deregulated {microRNAs} for biological characterization. Using this approach we characterize {miR}-204 as a tumor suppressor {microRNA} and uncover previously unknown connections between {microRNA} regulation, network topology, and expression dynamics. Specifically, we validate 18 gene targets of {miR}-204 that show elevated {mRNA} expression and are enriched in biological processes associated with tumor progression in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ({HNSCC}). We further demonstrate the enrichment of bottleneckness, a key molecular network topology, among {miR}-204 gene targets. Restoration of {miR}-204 function in {HNSCC} cell lines inhibits the expression of its functionally related gene targets, leads to the reduced adhesion, migration and invasion in vitro and attenuates experimental lung metastasis in vivo. As importantly, our investigation also provides experimental evidence linking the function of {microRNAs} that are located in the cancer-associated genomic regions ({CAGRs}) to the observed predisposition to human cancers. Specifically, we show {miR}-204 may serve as a tumor suppressor gene at the 9q21.1-22.3 {CAGR} locus, a well established risk factor locus in head and neck cancers for which tumor suppressor genes have not been identified. This new strategy that integrates expression profiling, genetics and novel computational biology approaches provides for improved efficiency in characterization and modeling of {microRNA} functions in cancer as compared to the state of art and is applicable to the investigation of {microRNA} functions in other biological processes and diseases.},

We show that when the {PMD} is applied using an L1-penalty on vk but not on uk, a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the “{SCoTLASS}” proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the {SCoTLASS} method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the {PMD} is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis ({CCA}).

For real data of which the dimensionality is unknown, the minimum spanning tree can provide a useful means of estimating this dimensionality. Nonmetric multidemensional scaling was also less susceptible to distortion of the ordination by single gradients of high beta diversity and two-gradient situations when each gradient is of a different beta diversity. A number of different similarity measures were evaluated for use in conjunction with nonmetric scaling and the cos theta coefficient was found to generally give good results.

Moreover, we found that {miR}-146b inhibited nuclear factor κB ({NF}-κB)-dependent production of {IL}-6, subsequent {STAT}3 activation, and {IL}-6/{STAT}3-driven migration and invasion in breast cancer cells, thereby establishing a negative feedback loop. In addition, higher expression of {miR}-146b was positively correlated with patient survival in breast cancer subtypes with increased {IL}6 expression and {STAT}3 phosphorylation. Our results identify an epigenetic mechanism of crosstalk between {STAT}3 and {NF}-κB relevant to constitutive {STAT}3 activation in malignancy and the role of inflammation in oncogenesis.},

	abstract = {Background
The {PathOlogist} is a new tool designed to transform large sets of gene expression data into quantitative descriptors of pathway-level behavior. The tool aims to provide a robust alternative to the search for single-gene-to-phenotype associations by accounting for the complexity of molecular interactions.

Results
Molecular abundance data is used to calculate two metrics - 'activity' and 'consistency' - for each pathway in a set of more than 500 canonical molecular pathways (source: Pathway Interaction Database, http://pid.nci.nih.gov). The tool then allows a detailed exploration of these metrics through integrated visualization of pathway components and structure, hierarchical clustering of pathways and samples, and statistical analyses designed to detect associations between pathway behavior and clinical features.

Conclusions
The {PathOlogist} provides a straightforward means to identify the functional processes, rather than individual molecules, that are altered in disease. The statistical power and biologic significance of this approach are made easily accessible to laboratory researchers and informatics analysts alike. Here we show as an example, how the {PathOlogist} can be used to establish pathway signatures that robustly differentiate breast cancer cell lines based on response to treatment.},

	abstract = {Background
To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis ({MCIA}), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, {MCIA} simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.

Results
We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using {MCIA}, applied to two typical “omics” research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the {NCI}-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation {RNA}-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of {RNA}-sequencing data processed using {RPKM} had greater variance than that with {MapSplice} and {RSEM}. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. {MCIA} is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor “omicade4” package.

Conclusion
We believe {MCIA} is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. {MCIA} provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Hypoxia in breast cancer is associated with poor prognosis and down-regulation of the estrogen receptor. Carbonic anhydrase {IX} ({CA} {IX}) is a hypoxia-inducible gene that has been associated with poor outcome in many epithelial cancers. Previous studies of {CA} {IX} in breast cancer have been carried out on mixed cohorts of premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with locally advanced disease and varying treatment regimens. We examined the potential prognostic and predictive role of {CA} {IX} in premenopausal breast cancer patients.


{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}

Using tissue microarrays, we analyzed {CA} {IX} expression in 400 stage {II} breast cancers from premenopausal women. The patients had previously participated in a randomized control trial comparing 2 years of tamoxifen to no systemic adjuvant treatment. Median follow-up was 13.9 years.


{RESULTS}

{CA} {IX} expression correlated positively with tumor size, grade, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, Ki-67, cyclin E, and cyclin A2 expression. {CA} {IX} expression correlated negatively with cyclin D1, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor. {CA} {IX} expression was associated with a reduced relapse-free survival (P=0.032), overall survival (P=0.022), and breast cancer-specific survival (P=0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that {CA} {IX} was an independent prognostic marker in untreated patients with one to three positive lymph nodes (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95\% confidence interval, 1.15-9.13; P=0.027).


{CONCLUSION}

{CA} {IX} is marker of poor prognosis in premenopausal breast cancer patients and it is an independent predictor of survival in patients with one to three positive lymph nodes. As all these patients received locoregional radiation therapy, {CA} {IX} may be associated with resistance to radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS}:: The insulin-like growth factor 2 ({IGF}2) gene is normally imprinted. Constitutive loss of imprinting ({LOI}) of {IGF}2 has been associated with increased risks of colon cancer and adenoma, indicating its role in carcinogenesis. The conventional {LOI} assay relies on a germline polymorphism to distinguish between 2 allelic expression patterns but results in many uninformative cases. {IGF}2 {LOI} correlates with hypomethylation at the differentially methylated region ({DMR})-0. An assay for methylation of the {DMR}0 could overcome the limitations of the conventional {IGF}2 {LOI} assay. {METHODS}:: We measured methylation at the {IGF}2 {DMR}0 using a bisulfite-pyrosequencing assay with 1178 paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer tissue samples from 2 prospective cohort studies. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate mortality hazard ratio ({HR}); calculations were adjusted for microsatellite instability, the {CpG} island methylator phenotype, {LINE}-1 methylation, and {KRAS}, {BRAF}, and {PIK}3CA mutations. {RESULTS}:: Methylation at the {IGF}2 {DMR}0 was successfully measured in 1105 (94\%) of 1178 samples. Colorectal tumors had significantly less methylation at the {DMR}0 compared to matched, normal colonic mucosa (P{\textless}0.0001; N=51). Among 1033 patients eligible for survival analysis, hypomethylation of the {IGF}2 {DMR}0 was significantly associated with higher overall mortality (log-rank P=0.0006; univariate {HR}=1.41, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 1.16-1.71, P=0.0006; multivariate {HR}=1.33, 95\% {CI}: 1.08-1.63, P=0.0066). {CONCLUSIONS}:: A bisulfite-pyrosequencing assay to measure methylation of the {IGF}2 {DMR}0 is robust and applicable to paraffin-embedded tissue. {IGF}2 {DMR}0 hypomethylation in colorectal tumor samples is associated with shorter survival time, so it might be developed as a prognostic biomarker.},

While immunotherapeutic strategies have conceptually held clinical promise, with the exception of a small percentage of patients, they have failed to demonstrate effective, consistent, and durable anti-cancer responses. Several subtypes of leukocytes that commonly infiltrate solid tumors harbor immunosuppressive activity and undoubtedly restrict the effectiveness of these strategies. Several of these same immune cells also foster tumor development by expression of potent protumor mediators. Given recent evidence revealing that immune-based mechanisms regulate the response to conventional cytotoxic therapy, it seems reasonable to speculate that tumor progression could be effectively diminished by combining cytotoxic strategies with therapies that blunt protumor immune-based effectors and/or neutralize those that instead impede development of desired anti-tumor immunity, thus providing synergistic effects between traditional cytotoxic and immune-modulatory approaches.},

	abstract = {Bone metastasis is an incurable complication of breast cancer affecting 70-80 \% of advanced patients. It is a multistep process that includes tumour cell mobilisation, intravasation, survival in the circulation, extravasation, migration and proliferation in the bone marrow/bone. Although novel findings demonstrate the bone marrow microenvironment significance in bone metastatic progression, a majority of studies have focused on end-stage disease and little is known about how the pre-metastatic niche arises in the bone marrow/bone tissues. We demonstrated a significant increase in patients' peripheral blood plasma ability to induce transendothelial migration of {MCF}-7 cells compared with healthy volunteers. Moreover, high {RANKL}, {MIF} and {OPG} levels in patients' peripheral blood could play a role in the intravasation, angiogenesis, survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of circulating tumour cells. Also, we observed a significant increase in patients' bone marrow plasma capacity to induce transendothelial migration of {MDA}-{MB}231 and {MCF}-7 cells compared with healthy volunteers. Furthermore, patients' bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells could control the recruitment of tumour cells, modifying the {MCF}-7 and {MDA}-{MB}231 cell migration. In addition, we found a significantly higher {MDA}-{MB}231 cell proliferation when we used patients' bone marrow plasma compared with healthy volunteers. Interestingly, {PDGF}-{AB}, {ICAM}-1 and {VCAM}-1 levels in patients' bone marrow were significantly higher than the values of healthy volunteers, suggesting that they could be involved in the cancer cell extravasation, bone resorption and cancer cell proliferation. We believe that these results can reveal new information about what alterations happen in the bone marrow of advanced breast cancer patients before bone colonisation, changes that create optimal soil for the metastatic cascade progression.},

In colorectal cancer, it has been found that the amount of stroma within the primary tumor is of prognostic value. We therefore have evaluated the prognostic value of this tumor-stroma ratio for breast cancer. A cohort of 574 early breast cancer patients, primarily treated with surgery between 1985 and 1994 was analyzed for the tumor-stroma ratio. The percentage of stroma was visually estimated on Haematoxylin-Eosin (H\&E) stained histological sections. Patients with more than 50\% intra-tumor stroma were quantified as stroma rich and patients with less than 50\% as stroma poor. For the total group of patients, stroma-rich tumors had a shorter relapse-free period ({RFP}) (P = 0.001) and overall survival ({OS}) (P = 0.025) compared to stroma-poor tumors. Tumor-stroma ratio was an independent prognostic parameter for the total group of patients (P {\textless} 0.001) and also in stratified analysis based on systemic treatment. Importantly, in the triple-negative cancer subpopulation, patients with stroma-rich tumors had a 2.92 times higher risk of relapse (P = 0.006) compared to those with stroma-poor tumors, independently of other clinico-pathological parameters. Five-year {RFP}-rates for triple-negative cancer patients with stroma-rich compared to stroma-poor tumors were 56 and 81\%, respectively. Tumor-stroma ratio has proven to be an independent prognostic factor for {RFP} in breast cancer patients and especially in the triple-negative cancer subpopulation. Tumor-stroma ratio could be easily implemented in routine daily pathology diagnostics, as it is simple to determine, reproducible, and performed in quick time.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: {miR}-409-3p/-5p is a {miRNA} expressed by embryonic stem cells, and its role in cancer biology and metastasis is unknown. Our pilot studies demonstrated elevated {miR}-409-3p/-5p expression in human prostate cancer bone metastatic cell lines; therefore, we defined the biologic impact of manipulation of {miR}-409-3p/-5p on prostate cancer progression and correlated the levels of its expression with clinical human prostate cancer bone metastatic specimens.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: {miRNA} profiling of a prostate cancer bone metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ({EMT}) cell line model was performed. A Gleason score human tissue array was probed for validation of specific {miRNAs}. In addition, genetic manipulation of {miR}-409-3p/-5p was performed to determine its role in tumor growth, {EMT}, and bone metastasis in mouse models.
{RESULTS}: Elevated expression of {miR}-409-3p/-5p was observed in bone metastatic prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate cancer tissues with higher Gleason scores. Elevated {miR}-409-3p expression levels correlated with progression-free survival of patients with prostate cancer. Orthotopic delivery of {miR}-409-3p/-5p in the murine prostate gland induced tumors where the tumors expressed {EMT} and stemness markers. Intracardiac inoculation (to mimic systemic dissemination) of {miR}-409-5p inhibitor-treated bone metastatic {ARCaPM} prostate cancer cells in mice led to decreased bone metastasis and increased survival compared with control vehicle-treated cells.
{CONCLUSION}: {miR}-409-3p/-5p plays an important role in prostate cancer biology by facilitating tumor growth, {EMT}, and bone metastasis. This finding bears particular translational importance as {miR}-409-3p/-5p appears to be an attractive biomarker and/or possibly a therapeutic target to treat bone metastatic prostate cancer.},

Meantime, Exo are recognized as an indispensable entity of physiological fluids [Caby et al., Int Immunol 17:879-887, 2005; Lasser et al., J Transl Med 9:9, 2011; Lasser et al., Am J Rhinol Allergy 25:89-93, 2011]. Exo and other types of extracellular vesicles, e.g., exosome-like vesicles [van Niel et al., Gastroenterology 121:337-349, 2001] and microvesicles ({MV}) [Daveloose et al., Thromb Res 22:195-201, 1981], contain multiple functional molecules including lipids [Vidal et al., J Cell Physiol 140:455-462, 1989]; proteins [Simpson et al., Expert Rev Proteomics 6:267-283, 2009]; {mRNA} [Valadi et al., Nat Cell Biol 9:654-659, 2007]; {DNA} [Waldenstrom et al., {PLoS} One 7:e34653, 2012]; noncoding {RNA}, e.g., {miRNA} [Simpson et al., Expert Rev Proteomics 6:267-283, 2009]; and retrotransposon elements [Balaj et al., Nat Commun 2:180, 2011]. Assessment of the biological functions of Exo showed that they deliver specifically their cargo from the donor to recipient cells. Albeit the molecular mechanisms of this process are not fully understood, approaches for the application of Exo and {MV} as a tool for a cell-specific delivery of signalling molecules were successfully tested in in vitro and in vivo models [Maguire et al., Mol Ther 20:960-971, 2012]. Ovarian cancer cells release Exo, which bind stroma cells as well as donor cancer cells [Escrevente et al., {BMC} Cancer 11:108, 2011]. Here we describe an experimental approach for the assessment of Exo interaction and uptake by target cells. Methods for the isolation and purification of Exo from cell culture supernatants are included. To allow visualization of vesicle uptake, labelling of Exo with different fluorescent dyes, such as {CFSE}, {PKH}, {DHPE}, and {DiOC}18, is presented.

Exosomes are enriched with a discrete set of cellular proteins, and therefore expected to exert diverse biological functions according to cell origin. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) possess the potential for differentiation into multilineages and can also function as precursors for tumor stroma including myofibroblast that provides a favorable environment for tumor progression. Although a close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a neoplastic tumor microenvironment has already been revealed, how this communication works is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of tumor cell-derived exosomes on {MSCs} by treating adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}) with breast cancer-derived exosomes. The exosome-treated {ADSCs} exhibited the phenotypes of tumor-associated myofibroblasts with increased expression of α-{SMA}. Exosome treatment also induced increased expression of tumor-promoting factors {SDF}-1, {VEGF}, {CCL}5 and {TGFβ}. This phenomenon was correlated with increased expression of {TGFβ} receptor I and {II}. Analysis of {SMAD}2, a key player in the {TGFβ} receptor-mediated {SMAD} pathway, revealed that its phosphorylation was increased by exosome treatment and was inhibited by treatment with {SB}431542, an inhibitor of the {SMAD}-mediated pathway, resulting in decreased expression of α-{SMA}. Taken together, our results show that tumor-derived exosomes induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} via the {SMAD}-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that tumor-derived exosomes can contribute to progression and malignancy of tumor cells by converting {MSCs} within tumor stroma into tumor-associated myofibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryA} cancer genome typically harbors both driver mutations, which contribute to tumorigenesis, and passenger mutations, which tend to be neutral and occur randomly. Cancer genomes differ dramatically due to genetic and environmental factors. A major challenge in interpreting the large volume of mutation data identified in cancer genomes using next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) is to distinguish driver mutations from neutral passenger mutations. We propose a novel mutation network method, {VarWalker}, to prioritize driver genes in large scale cancer mutation data. Applying our approach in a large cohort of lung adenocarcinoma samples and melanoma samples, we derived a consensus mutation subnetwork for each cancer containing significantly enriched cancer genes and cancer-related functional pathways. Our results indicated that driver genes occur within a broad spectrum of frequency, interact with each other, and converge in several key pathways that play critical roles in tumorigenesis.},

Furthermore, metastatic cell variants have been shown to preexist in murine neoplasms of old and recent origin. The possible existence of highly metastatic variant cells within a primary tumor suggests that we no longer should consider a neoplasm to be a uniform entity.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) are the most common genetic variations in the human genome and are useful as genomic markers. Oligonucleotide {SNP} microarrays have been developed for high-throughput genotyping of up to 900,000 human {SNPs} and have been used widely in linkage and cancer genomics studies. We have previously used Hidden Markov Models ({HMM}) to analyze {SNP} array data for inferring copy numbers and loss-of-heterozygosity ({LOH}) from paired normal and tumor samples and unpaired tumor samples.
{RESULTS}: We proposed and implemented major copy proportion ({MCP}) analysis of oligonucleotide {SNP} array data. A {HMM} was constructed to infer unobserved {MCP} states from observed allele-specific signals through emission and transition distributions. We used 10 K, 100 K and 250 K {SNP} array datasets to compare {MCP} analysis with {LOH} and copy number analysis, and showed that {MCP} performs better than {LOH} analysis for allelic-imbalanced chromosome regions and normal contaminated samples. The major and minor copy alleles can also be inferred from allelic-imbalanced regions by {MCP} analysis.
{CONCLUSION}: {MCP} extends tumor {LOH} analysis to allelic imbalance analysis and supplies complementary information to total copy numbers. {MCP} analysis of mixing normal and tumor samples suggests the utility of {MCP} analysis of normal-contaminated tumor samples. The described analysis and visualization methods are readily available in the user-friendly {dChip} software.},

Although a close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a neoplastic tumor microenvironment has already been revealed, how this communication works is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of tumor cell-derived exosomes on {MSCs} by treating adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}) with breast cancer-derived exosomes.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Microarrays have been a popular tool for gene expression profiling at genome-scale for over a decade due to the low cost, short turn-around time, excellent quantitative accuracy and ease of data generation. The Bioconductor package puma incorporates a suite of analysis methods for determining uncertainties from Affymetrix {GeneChip} data and propagating these uncertainties to downstream analysis. As isoform level expression profiling receives more and more interest within genomics in recent years, exon microarray technology offers an important tool to quantify expression level of the majority of exons and enables the possibility of measuring isoform level expression. However, puma does not include methods for the analysis of exon array data. Moreover, the current expression summarisation method for Affymetrix 3' {GeneChip} data suffers from instability for low expression genes. For the downstream analysis, the method for differential expression detection is computationally intensive and the original expression clustering method does not consider the variance across the replicated technical and biological measurements. It is therefore necessary to develop improved uncertainty propagation methods for gene and transcript expression analysis.
{RESULTS}: We extend the previously developed Bioconductor package puma with a new method especially designed for {GeneChip} Exon arrays and a set of improved downstream approaches. The improvements include: (i) a new gamma model for exon arrays which calculates isoform and gene expression measurements and a level of uncertainty associated with the estimates, using the multi-mappings between probes, isoforms and genes, (ii) a variant of the existing approach for the probe-level analysis of Affymetrix 3' {GeneChip} data to produce more stable gene expression estimates, (iii) an improved method for detecting differential expression which is computationally more efficient than the existing approach in the package and (iv) an improved method for robust model-based clustering of gene expression, which takes technical and biological replicate information into consideration.
{CONCLUSIONS}: With the extensions and improvements, the puma package is now applicable to the analysis of both Affymetrix 3' {GeneChips} and Exon arrays for gene and isoform expression estimation. It propagates the uncertainty of expression measurements into more efficient and comprehensive downstream analysis at both gene and isoform level. Downstream methods are also applicable to other expression quantification platforms, such as {RNA}-Seq, when uncertainty information is available from expression measurements. puma is available through Bioconductor and can be found at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

Penalized regression methods have been adopted widely for high-dimensional feature selection and prediction in many bioinformatic and biostatistical contexts. While their theoretical properties are well-understood, specific methodology for their optimal application to genomic data has not been determined.


{RESULTS}

Through simulation of contrasting scenarios of correlated high-dimensional survival data, we compared the {LASSO}, Ridge and Elastic Net penalties for prediction and variable selection. We found that a 2D tuning of the Elastic Net penalties was necessary to avoid mimicking the performance of {LASSO} or Ridge regression. Furthermore, we found that in a simulated scenario favoring the {LASSO} penalty, a univariate pre-filter made the Elastic Net behave more like Ridge regression, which was detrimental to prediction performance. We demonstrate the real-life application of these methods to predicting the survival of cancer patients from microarray data, and to classification of obese and lean individuals from metagenomic data. Based on these results, we provide an optimized set of guidelines for the application of penalized regression for reproducible class comparison and prediction with genomic data. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: A parallelized implementation of the methods presented for regression and for simulation of synthetic data is provided as the pensim R package, available at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pensim/index.html.

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Rapidly expanding repositories of highly informative genomic data have generated increasing interest in methods for protein function prediction and inference of biological networks. The successful application of supervised machine learning to these tasks requires a gold standard for protein function: a trusted set of correct examples, which can be used to assess performance through cross-validation or other statistical approaches. Since gene annotation is incomplete for even the best studied model organisms, the biological reliability of such evaluations may be called into question. {RESULTS}: We address this concern by constructing and analyzing an experimentally based gold standard through comprehensive validation of protein function predictions for mitochondrion biogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specifically, we determine that (i) current machine learning approaches are able to generalize and predict novel biology from an incomplete gold standard and (ii) incomplete functional annotations adversely affect the evaluation of machine learning performance. While computational approaches performed better than predicted in the face of incomplete data, relative comparison of competing approaches-even those employing the same training data-is problematic with a sparse gold standard. Incomplete knowledge causes individual methods' performances to be differentially underestimated, resulting in misleading performance evaluations. We provide a benchmark gold standard for yeast mitochondria to complement current databases and an analysis of our experimental results in the hopes of mitigating these effects in future comparative evaluations. {AVAILABILITY}: The mitochondrial benchmark gold standard, as well as experimental results and additional data, is available at http://function.princeton.edu/mitochondria.},

The exosomes derived from ovarian cancer cell lines were round and mostly 30-100nm in diameter when viewed under an electron microscope. The exosomal marker proteins {TSG}101 and Alix were detected in exosome preparations. The range of density was between 1.09g/ml and 1.15g/ml. A total of 2230 proteins were identified from two ovarian cell-derived exosomes. Among them, 1017 proteins were identified in both exosomes including all of the major exosomal protein markers. There were 380 proteins that are not reported in the {ExoCarta} database. In addition to common proteins from exosomes of various origins, our results showed that ovarian cancer-derived exosomes also carried tissue specific proteins associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis, especially in ovarian carcinoma.

However, methods for measuring expression typically involve a trade-off between imaging-based methods, which give the precise location of a limited number of genes, and higher throughput methods such as {RNA}-seq, which include all genes, but are more limited in their resolution to apply to many tissues. We propose an intermediate method, which estimates expression in individual cells, based on high-throughput measurements of expression from multiple overlapping groups of cells. This approach has particular benefits in organisms such as C. elegans where invariant developmental patterns make it possible to define these overlapping populations of cells at single-cell resolution.
{RESULT}: We implement several methods to deconvolve the gene expression in individual cells from population-level data and determine the accuracy of these estimates on simulated data from the C. elegans embryo.
{CONCLUSION}: These simulations suggest that a high-resolution map of expression in the C. elegans embryo may be possible with expression data from as few as 30 cell populations.},

	abstract = {The discovery of the p53 tumor suppressor protein in 1979 shed new light on cancer cell biology and introduced a trend in cancer research focusing on p53-like proteins. This in turn led to the discovery of two homologous proteins of p53-p63 in 1998 and p73 in 1997. The p53 family members are mainly involved in apoptosis induction under cellular stress, but also in early embryonic developmental processes. The p63 and p73 proteins activate the transcription of a number of p53 target genes. The precise role of p63 in cancer cells is not fully revealed yet, unlike that of p53 and p73. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is found inactive in approximately 50\% of human cancers. However, p73 is not as often inactivated in tumors. Of importance, transcriptionally active forms of p73 induce apoptosis in cancer cells independent of p53 status. Moreover, the regulatory mechanisms governing p73 stability in cells are well described. These features promoted the research concerning p73-targeted anti-cancer treatment. The p73 protein is subject to sophisticated activatory and inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. The up-to-date anti-cancer compounds targeting p73 protein in vitro inhibit its negative regulators, which leads to the activation of p73 pro-apoptotic function in cancer cells. In the current review we present the recent scientific findings on p73 regulation in cells and the newest anti-cancer strategies concerning its tumor suppressor function.},

	abstract = {Previous studies indicate that bone morphogenetic protein ({BMP}) 6 is involved in breast cancer development and progression. However, the mechanism underlying the role of {BMP}6 in breast cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and chemoresistance remains unknown. In this study, we confirmed that {BMP}6 expression was downregulated in breast cancer tissues compared with the adjacent normal breast tissues. We further demonstrated that the downregulation of {BMP}6 was correlated with the estrogen receptor ({ER}) and progesterone receptor ({PR}) status, tumor grade and enhanced proliferation (Ki67 proliferation index). In vitro functional experiments showed that the suppression of {BMP}6 expression by a specific small hairpin (sh){RNA} vector led to increased proliferation in the {MCF}7 breast cancer cell line. Furthermore, knockdown of {BMP}6 in {MCF}7 cells enhanced the chemoresistance to doxorubicin by upregulation of mdr-1/P-gp expression and activation of the {ERK} signaling pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that {BMP}6 plays a critical role in breast cancer cell aberrant proliferation and chemoresistance and may serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target for breast cancer.},

Recent proteomic analyses have shown that the nucleolus contains proteins involved in cell cycle control, {DNA} processing and {DNA} damage response and repair, in addition to the many proteins connected with ribosome subunit production. Here we study the dynamics of nucleolar protein responses in cells exposed to stress and {DNA} damage caused by ionizing and ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation in diploid human fibroblasts. We show using a combination of imaging and quantitative proteomics methods that nucleolar substructure and the nucleolar proteome undergo selective reorganization in response to {UV} damage. The proteomic responses to {UV} include alterations of functional protein complexes such as the {SSU} processome and exosome, and paraspeckle proteins, involving both decreases and increases in steady state protein ratios, respectively. Several nonhomologous end-joining proteins ({NHEJ}), such as Ku70/80, display similar fast responses to {UV}. In contrast, nucleolar proteomic responses to {IR} are both temporally and spatially distinct from those caused by {UV}, and more limited in terms of magnitude. With the exception of the {NHEJ} and paraspeckle proteins, where {IR} induces rapid and transient changes within 15 min of the damage, {IR} does not alter the ratios of most other functional nucleolar protein complexes. The rapid transient decrease of {NHEJ} proteins in the nucleolus indicates that it may reflect a response to {DNA} damage. Our results underline that the nucleolus is a specific stress response organelle that responds to different damage and stress agents in a unique, damage-specific manner.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Single sample predictors ({SSPs}) and Subtype classification models ({SCMs}) are gene expression-based classifiers used to identify the four primary molecular subtypes of breast cancer (basal-like, {HER}2-enriched, luminal A, and luminal B). {SSPs} use hierarchical clustering, followed by nearest centroid classification, based on large sets of tumor-intrinsic genes. {SCMs} use a mixture of Gaussian distributions based on sets of genes with expression specifically correlated with three key breast cancer genes (estrogen receptor [{ER}], {HER}2, and aurora kinase A [{AURKA}]). The aim of this study was to compare the robustness, classification concordance, and prognostic value of these classifiers with those of a simplified three-gene {SCM} in a large compendium of microarray datasets.
{METHODS}: Thirty-six publicly available breast cancer datasets (n = 5715) were subjected to molecular subtyping using five published classifiers (three {SSPs} and two {SCMs}) and {SCMGENE}, the new three-gene ({ER}, {HER}2, and {AURKA}) {SCM}. We used the prediction strength statistic to estimate robustness of the classification models, defined as the capacity of a classifier to assign the same tumors to the same subtypes independently of the dataset used to fit it. We used Cohen κ and Cramer V coefficients to assess concordance between the subtype classifiers and association with clinical variables, respectively. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and cross-validated partial likelihood to compare prognostic value of the resulting classifications. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: {SCMs} were statistically significantly more robust than {SSPs}, with {SCMGENE} being the most robust because of its simplicity. {SCMGENE} was statistically significantly concordant with published {SCMs} (κ = 0.65-0.70) and {SSPs} (κ = 0.34-0.59), statistically significantly associated with {ER} (V = 0.64), {HER}2 (V = 0.52) status, and histological grade (V = 0.55), and yielded similar strong prognostic value.
{CONCLUSION}: Our results suggest that adequate classification of the major and clinically relevant molecular subtypes of breast cancer can be robustly achieved with quantitative measurements of three key genes.},

African Americans had higher breast cancer-specific mortality than whites, but the effect of race was statistically significant only among women with luminal A breast cancer. However, when compared with the luminal A subtype within racial categories, mortality for participants with basal-like breast cancer was higher among whites ({HR} = 2.0, 95\% {CI}: 1.2-3.4) than African Americans ({HR} = 1.5, 95\% {CI}: 1.0-2.4), with the strongest effect seen in postmenopausal white women ({HR} = 3.9, 95\% {CI}: 1.5-10.0). {CONCLUSIONS} Our results confirm the association of basal-like breast cancer with poor prognosis and suggest that basal-like breast cancer is not an inherently more aggressive disease in African American women compared with whites. Additional analyses are needed in populations with known treatment profiles to understand the role of tumor subtypes and race in breast cancer mortality, and in particular our finding that among women with luminal A breast cancer, African Americans have higher mortality than whites.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Von Hippel-Lindau ({VHL}) disease is an inherited syndrome caused by germline mutations in the {VHL} tumor suppressor gene, predisposing to a variety of neoplasms including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ({PanNET}). In {VHL} disease, {PanNET} probably progress according to a specific pathway of carcinogenesis. Our aim was to characterize by molecular quantitative analysis a panel of molecules implicated in the {VHL} pathway and in tumor progression in the {PanNET} of patients with {VHL}.


{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}

The expression of 52 genes was studied by quantitative reverse transcriptase {PCR} in 18 patients with {VHL} operated on for {PanNET} and compared with 16 non-{VHL} {PanNET}. The {VHL} and non-{VHL} tumors were matched according to their size and cell proliferation. For some genes, we looked for differences in the protein expression in {VHL} {PanNET} (n = 31), microadenomas (n = 22), and non-{VHL} {PanNET} (n = 16), included in tissue microarray blocks.


{RESULTS}

Nineteen (36\%) genes were significantly upregulated and three (6\%) downregulated in {VHL} {PanNET}. The upregulated genes were related to (i) hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF}) molecules ({CA}9, {HIF}2A, and {GLUT}1), (ii) angiogenesis ({CDH}5, {VEGFR}1, {EDNRA}, {ANGPT}2, {CD}34, {VEGFR}2, {VEGFA}, and {ANGPT}1), (iii) the processes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ({VIM}) and/or metastasis ({LAMA}4 and {CXCR}4), (iv) growth factors and receptors ({PDGFB}, {IRS}1, and {ERBB}1), or (v) cell cycle ({CCND}1 and {CDKN}2A). The downregulated genes were related to (i) {EMT} ({OCLN}) and (ii) signaling pathways ({RPS}6KB1 and {GADD}45B).


{CONCLUSION}

This study shows that the progression of {PanNET} in patients with {VHL} tumors follows a specific pathway and supports that targeting molecules specifically involved may be of therapeutic importance.},

To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging ({CS}-{BLI}) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. {CS}-{BLI} is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, {NF}-{kappaB}, {HIF}-1alpha, myc, {hTERT} and {IRF}4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, {CS}-{BLI} can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of {CS}-{BLI}, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.},

Final surgery was a mastectomy in 70\% of patients with {ILC} (34\% were reoperated after initial partial mastectomy) and in 52\% of {IDC} after 8\% of reoperation (P=0.006). A pathological complete response ({pCR}) was achieved in 1\% of {ILC} and 9\% of {IDC} (P=0.002). The outcome at 60 months was significantly better for {ILC}, but histologic type was not an independent factor for survival in multivariate analysis. {CONCLUSIONS}: {ILC} appeared less responsive to chemotherapy but presented a better outcome than {IDC}.

	abstract = {Cancer cells possess traits reminiscent of those ascribed to normal stem cells. It is unclear, however, whether these phenotypic similarities reflect the activity of common molecular pathways. Here we analyze the enrichment patterns of gene sets associated with embryonic stem ({ES}) cell identity in the expression profiles of various human tumor types. Strikingly, histologically poorly differentiated tumors display preferential overexpression of genes normally enriched in {ES} cells, combined with underexpression of Polycomb-regulated genes. Moreover, expression of activation targets of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc is observed more frequently in poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. In breast cancers this {ES}-like signature is associated with high-grade {ER}-negative tumors, often of the basal-like subtype, and with poor clinical outcome. The {ES} signature is also present in poorly differentiated glioblastomas and bladder carcinomas. We identify a subset of {ES}-associated transcription regulators that are preferentially expressed in poorly differentiated tumors. Our results reveal a novel link between genes associated with {ES} cell identity and the histopathological traits of tumors, and support the possibility that these genes contribute to stem cell-like phenotypes displayed by many tumors.},

We describe an analytical framework based on multiscale statistical mechanics that integrates genomic and biophysical data to model the human {SH}2-phosphoprotein network in normal and cancer cells. We apply our approach to data in The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) and test model predictions experimentally. We find that mutations mapping to phosphoproteins often create new interactions but that mutations altering {SH}2 domains result almost exclusively in loss of interactions. Some of these mutations eliminate all interactions, but many cause more selective loss, thereby rewiring specific edges in highly connected subnetworks. Moreover, idiosyncratic mutations appear to be as functionally consequential as recurrent mutations. By synthesizing genomic, structural and biochemical data, our framework represents a new approach to the interpretation of genetic variation.},

	abstract = {With the advent of high-throughput technologies for data acquisition from different components (i.e., genes, proteins, and metabolites) of a given biological system, generation of hypotheses, and biological interpretations based on multivariate data sets become increasingly important. These technologies allow for simultaneous gathering of data from the same biological components under different perturbations, including genotypic variation and/or changes in conditions, resulting in so-called multiple data tables. Moreover, these data tables are obtained over a well-chosen time domain to capture the dynamics of the response of the biological system to the perturbation. The computational problem we address in this study is twofold: (1) derive a single data table, referred to as a compromise, which captures information common to the investigated set of multiple tables and (2) identify biological components which contribute most to the determined compromise. Here we argue that recent extensions to principle component analysis called {STATIS} and dual-{STATIS} can be used to determine the compromise on which classical techniques for data analysis, such as clustering and term over-enrichment, can be subsequently applied. In addition, we illustrate that {STATIS} and dual-{STATIS} facilitate interpretations of a publically available transcriptomics data set capturing the time-resolved response of Arabidopsis thaliana to changing light and/or temperature conditions. We demonstrate that {STATIS} and dual-{STATIS} can be used not only to identify the components of a biological system whose behavior is similarly affected due to the perturbation (e.g., in time or condition), but also to specify the extent to which each dimension of the data tables reflect the perturbation. These findings ultimately provide insights in the components and pathways which could be under tight control in plant systems.},

	abstract = {Poly ({ADP}-ribose) polymerase ({PARP}) inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapies have been found to be particularly effective in tumors that harbor deleterious germline or somatic mutations in the {BRCA}1 or {BRCA}2 genes, the products of which contribute to the conservative homologous recombination repair of {DNA} double-strand breaks. Nonetheless, several setbacks in clinical trial settings have highlighted some of the issues surrounding the investigation of {PARP} inhibitors, especially the identification of patients who stand to benefit from such drugs. One potential approach to finding this patient subpopulation is to examine the tumor {DNA} for evidence of a homologous recombination defect. However, although the genomes of many breast and ovarian cancers are replete with aberrations, the presence of numerous factors able to shape the genomic landscape means that only some of the observed {DNA} abnormalities are the outcome of a cancer cell's inability to faithfully repair {DNA} double-strand breaks. Consequently, recently developed methods for comprehensively capturing the diverse ways in which homologous recombination deficiencies may arise beyond {BRCA}1/2 mutation have used {DNA} microarray and sequencing data to account for potentially confounding features in the genome. Scores capturing telomeric allelic imbalance, loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}) and large scale transition score, as well as the total number of coding mutations are measures that summarize the total burden of certain forms of genomic abnormality. By contrast, other studies have comprehensively catalogued different types of mutational pattern and their relative contributions to a given tumor sample. Although at least one study to explore the use of the {LOH} scar in a prospective clinical trial of a {PARP} inhibitor in ovarian cancer is under way, limitations that result in a relatively low positive predictive value for these biomarkers remain. Tumors whose genome has undergone one or more events that restore high-fidelity homologous recombination are likely to be misclassified as double-strand break repair-deficient and thereby sensitive to {PARP} inhibitors and {DNA} damaging chemotherapies as a result of prior repair deficiency and its genomic scarring. Therefore, we propose that integration of a genomic scar-based biomarker with a marker of resistance in a high genomic scarring burden context may improve the performance of any companion diagnostic for {PARP} inhibitors.},

{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: In all, 1,951 patients with node-negative, early-stage {BC} randomly assigned in International Breast Cancer Study Group Trials {VIII} and {IX} with centrally reviewed pathology data were included. {BC} subtypes were defined as triple negative ({TN}; n = 310), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2) positive (n = 369), and hormone receptor positive with high (luminal B-like [{LB}-like]; n = 763) or low (luminal A-like [{LA}-like]; n = 509) proliferative activity by Ki-67 labeling index. {BC}-free interval ({BCFI}) events were invasive {BC} recurrence in local, contralateral breast, nodal, bone, or visceral sites. Time to first site-specific recurrence was evaluated by using cumulative incidence and competing risks regression analysis.
{RESULTS}: Median follow-up was 12.5 years. The 10-year {BCFI} was higher for patients with {LA}-like (86\%) {BC} compared with {LB}-like (76\%), {HER}2 (73\%), and {TN} (71\%; P {\textless} .001) {BC}. {TN} and {HER}2 cohorts had higher hazard of {BCFI} event in the first 4 years after diagnosis (pre-trastuzumab). {LB}-like cohorts had a continuously higher hazard of {BCFI} event over time compared with {LA}-like cohorts. Ten-year overall survival was higher for {LA}-like (89\%) compared with {LB}-like (83\%), {HER}2 (77\%), and {TN} (75\%; P {\textless} .001) {BC}. {LB}-like subtypes had higher rates of bone as first recurrence site than other subtypes (P = .005). Visceral recurrence as first site was lower for the {LA}-like subgroup, with similar incidence among the other subgroups when treated with chemotherapy (P = .003).
{CONCLUSION}: {BC} subtypes have different distant recurrence patterns over time. Defining different patterns of {BC} recurrence can improve {BC} care through surveillance guidelines and can guide the design of clinical studies.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0017474},
	abstract = {Microarray experiments have been extensively used to define signatures, which are sets of genes that can be considered markers of experimental conditions (typically diseases). Paradoxically, in spite of the apparent functional role that might be attributed to such gene sets, signatures do not seem to be reproducible across experiments. Given the close relationship between function and protein interaction, network properties can be used to study to what extent signatures are composed of genes whose resulting proteins show a considerable level of interaction (and consequently a putative common functional role).

We have analysed 618 signatures and 507 modules of co-expression in cancer looking for significant values of four main protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) network parameters: connection degree, cluster coefficient, betweenness and number of components. A total of 3904 gene ontology ({GO}) modules, 146 {KEGG} pathways, and 263 Biocarta pathways have been used as functional modules of reference.

Co-expression modules found in microarray experiments display a high level of connectivity, similar to the one shown by conventional modules based on functional definitions ({GO}, {KEGG} and Biocarta). A general observation for all the classes studied is that the networks formed by the modules improve their topological parameters when an external protein is allowed to be introduced within the paths (up to the 70\% of {GO} modules show network parameters beyond the random expectation). This fact suggests that functional definitions are incomplete and some genes might still be missing. Conversely, signatures are clearly not capturing the altered functions in the corresponding studies. This is probably because the way in which the genes have been selected in the signatures is too conservative. These results suggest that gene selection methods which take into account relationships among genes should be superior to methods that assume independence among genes outside their functional contexts.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate that {FAS} {mRNA} expression is physiologically regulated by fasting and refeeding in the {VMN} but not in other hypothalamic nuclei. Thus, the {VMN} appears to be the hypothalamic site where regulation of {FAS} and feeding converge. Supporting the potential clinical relevance of these observations, reanalysis of a primary breast cancer prevention study showed that obese women treated with {TMX} gained significantly less body weight over a 6-year period than obese women given placebo.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Microarrays have been a popular tool for gene expression profiling at genome-scale for over a decade due to the low cost, short turn-around time, excellent quantitative accuracy and ease of data generation. The Bioconductor package puma incorporates a suite of analysis methods for determining uncertainties from Affymetrix {GeneChip} data and propagating these uncertainties to downstream analysis. As isoform level expression profiling receives more and more interest within genomics in recent years, exon microarray technology offers an important tool to quantify expression level of the majority of exons and enables the possibility of measuring isoform level expression. However, puma does not include methods for the analysis of exon array data. Moreover, the current expression summarisation method for Affymetrix 3' {GeneChip} data suffers from instability for low expression genes. For the downstream analysis, the method for differential expression detection is computationally intensive and the original expression clustering method does not consider the variance across the replicated technical and biological measurements. It is therefore necessary to develop improved uncertainty propagation methods for gene and transcript expression analysis.
{RESULTS}: We extend the previously developed Bioconductor package puma with a new method especially designed for {GeneChip} Exon arrays and a set of improved downstream approaches. The improvements include: (i) a new gamma model for exon arrays which calculates isoform and gene expression measurements and a level of uncertainty associated with the estimates, using the multi-mappings between probes, isoforms and genes, (ii) a variant of the existing approach for the probe-level analysis of Affymetrix 3' {GeneChip} data to produce more stable gene expression estimates, (iii) an improved method for detecting differential expression which is computationally more efficient than the existing approach in the package and (iv) an improved method for robust model-based clustering of gene expression, which takes technical and biological replicate information into consideration.
{CONCLUSIONS}: With the extensions and improvements, the puma package is now applicable to the analysis of both Affymetrix 3' {GeneChips} and Exon arrays for gene and isoform expression estimation. It propagates the uncertainty of expression measurements into more efficient and comprehensive downstream analysis at both gene and isoform level. Downstream methods are also applicable to other expression quantification platforms, such as {RNA}-Seq, when uncertainty information is available from expression measurements. puma is available through Bioconductor and can be found at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

However, a considerable proportion of women suffer recurrent cancer at distant metastatic sites despite adjuvant treatment. Identification of the genes crucial for tumor response to specific chemotherapy drugs is a challenge but is necessary to improve outcomes. By using integrated genomics, we identified a small number of overexpressed and amplified genes from chromosome 8q22 that were associated with early disease recurrence despite anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. We confirmed the association in an analysis of multiple independent cohorts. {SiRNA}-mediated knockdown of either of two of these genes, the antiapoptotic gene {YWHAZ} and a lysosomal gene {LAPTM}4B, sensitized tumor cells to anthracyclines, and overexpression of either of the genes induced anthracycline resistance. Overexpression of {LAPTM}4B resulted in sequestration of the anthracycline doxorubicin, delaying its appearance in the nucleus. Overexpression of these two genes was associated with poor tumor response to anthracycline treatment in a neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial in women with primary breast cancer. Our results suggest that 8q22 amplification and overexpression of {LAPTM}4B and {YWHAZ} contribute to de novo chemoresistance to anthracyclines and are permissive for metastatic recurrence. Overexpression of these two genes may predict anthracycline resistance and influence selection of chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {Basal-like breast cancer ({BBC}) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that has no biologically targeted therapy. The interactions of {BBCs} with stromal cells are important determinants of tumor biology, with inflammatory cells playing well-recognized roles in cancer progression. Despite the fact that macrophage-{BBC} communication is bidirectional, important questions remain about how {BBCs} affect adjacent immune cells. This study investigated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and polarization and gene expression in response to coculture with basal-like versus luminal breast cancer cells. Changes induced by coculture were compared with changes observed under classical differentiation and polarization conditions. Monocytes ({THP}-1 cells) exposed to {BBC} cells in coculture had altered gene expression with upregulation of both M1 and M2 macrophage markers. Two sets of M1 and M2 markers were selected from the {PCR} profiles and used for dual immunofluorescent staining of {BBC} versus luminal cocultured {THP}-1s, and cancer-adjacent, benign tissue sections from patients diagnosed with {BBCs} or luminal breast cancer, confirming the differential expression patterns. Relative to luminal breast cancers, {BBCs} also increased differentiation of monocytes to macrophages and stimulated macrophage migration. Consistent with these changes in cellular phenotype, a distinct pattern of cytokine secretion was evident in macrophage-{BBC} cocultures, including upregulation of {NAP}-2, osteoprotegerin, {MIG}, {MCP}-1, {MCP}-3, and interleukin ({IL})-1β. Application of {IL}-1 receptor antagonist ({IL}-1RA) to cocultures attenuated {BBC}-induced macrophage migration. These data contribute to an understanding of the {BBC}-mediated activation of the stromal immune response, implicating specific cytokines that are differentially expressed in basal-like microenvironments and suggesting plausible targets for modulating immune responses to {BBCs}.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: High-grade serous cancer ({HGSC}) is the most common cancer of the ovary and is characterized by chromosomal instability. Defects in homologous recombination repair ({HRR}) are associated with genomic instability in {HGSC}, and are exploited by therapy targeting {DNA} repair. Defective {HRR} causes uniparental deletions and loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}). Our purpose is to profile {LOH} in {HGSC} and correlate our findings to clinical outcome, and compare {HGSC} and high-grade breast cancers.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We examined {LOH} and copy number changes using single nucleotide polymorphism array data from three {HGSC} cohorts and compared results to a cohort of high-grade breast cancers. The {LOH} profiles in {HGSC} were matched to chemotherapy resistance and progression-free survival ({PFS}).
{RESULTS}: {LOH}-based clustering divided {HGSC} into two clusters. The major group displayed extensive {LOH} and was further divided into two subgroups. The second group contained remarkably less {LOH}. {BRCA}1 promoter methylation was associated with the major group. {LOH} clusters were reproducible when validated in two independent {HGSC} datasets. {LOH} burden in the major cluster of {HGSC} was similar to triple-negative, and distinct from other high-grade breast cancers. Our analysis revealed an {LOH} cluster with lower treatment resistance and a significant correlation between {LOH} burden and {PFS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Separating {HGSC} by {LOH}-based clustering produces remarkably stable subgroups in three different cohorts. Patients in the various {LOH} clusters differed with respect to chemotherapy resistance, and the extent of {LOH} correlated with {PFS}. {LOH} burden may indicate vulnerability to treatment targeting {DNA} repair, such as {PARP}1 inhibitors.},

Reformulating this multilinear {HOSVD} such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this {HOSVD} with an integration of genome-scale {mRNA} expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression.

	abstract = {Although individual tumors of the same clinical type have surprisingly diverse genomic alterations, these events tend to occur in a limited number of pathways, and alterations that affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient. While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer ({MEMo}). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2) member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), the method identifies the principal known altered modules in glioblastoma ({GBM}) and highlights the striking mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in the {PI}(3)K, p53, and Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel observation that inactivation of {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 is mutually exclusive of amplification of {CCNE}1 and inactivation of {RB}1, suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability in this cancer type; and, we identify {RBBP}8 as a candidate oncogene involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any cancer genomics data set, the algorithm can nominate oncogenic alterations that have a particularly strong selective effect and may also be useful in the design of therapeutic combinations in cases where mutual exclusivity reflects synthetic lethality.},

	volume = {10},

	abstract = {Background In contemporary biology, complex biological processes are increasingly studied by collecting and analyzing measurements of the same entities that are collected with different analytical platforms. Such data comprise a number of data blocks that are coupled via a common mode. The goal of collecting this type of data is to discover biological mechanisms that underlie the behavior of the variables in the different data blocks. The simultaneous component analysis ({SCA}) family of data analysis methods is suited for this task. However, a {SCA} may be hampered by the data blocks being subjected to different amounts of measurement error, or noise. To unveil the true mechanisms underlying the data, it could be fruitful to take noise heterogeneity into consideration in the data analysis. Maximum likelihood based {SCA} ({MxLSCA}-P) was developed for this purpose. In a previous simulation study it outperformed normal {SCA}-P. This previous study, however, did not mimic in many respects typical functional genomics data sets, such as, data blocks coupled via the experimental mode, more variables than experimental units, and medium to high correlations between variables. Here, we present a new simulation study in which the usefulness of {MxLSCA}-P compared to ordinary {SCA}-P is evaluated within a typical functional genomics setting. Subsequently, the performance of the two methods is evaluated by analysis of a real life Escherichia coli metabolomics data set. Results In the simulation study, {MxLSCA}-P outperforms {SCA}-P in terms of recovery of the true underlying scores of the common mode and of the true values underlying the data entries. {MxLSCA}-P further performed especially better when the simulated data blocks were subject to different noise levels. In the analysis of an E. coli metabolomics data set, {MxLSCA}-P provided a slightly better and more consistent interpretation. Conclusion {MxLSCA}-P is a promising addition to the {SCA} family. The analysis of coupled functional genomics data blocks could benefit from its ability to take different noise levels per data block into consideration and improve the recovery of the true patterns underlying the data. Moreover, the maximum likelihood based approach underlying {MxLSCA}-P could be extended to custom-made solutions to specific problems encountered.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Ovarian cancer causes more than 15000 deaths per year in the United States. The survival of patients is quite heterogeneous, and accurate prognostic tools would help with the clinical management of these patients.
{METHODS}: We developed and validated two gene expression signatures, the first for predicting survival in advanced-stage, serous ovarian cancer and the second for predicting debulking status. We integrated 13 publicly available datasets totaling 1525 subjects. We trained prediction models using a meta-analysis variation on the compound covariable method, tested models by a "leave-one-dataset-out" procedure, and validated models in additional independent datasets. Selected genes from the debulking signature were validated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ({qRT}-{PCR}) in two further independent cohorts of 179 and 78 patients, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: The survival signature stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups (hazard ratio = 2.19; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.84 to 2.61) statistically significantly better than the {TCGA} signature (P = .04). {POSTN}, {CXCL}14, {FAP}, {NUAK}1, {PTCH}1, and {TGFBR}2 were validated by {qRT}-{PCR} (P {\textless} .05) and {POSTN}, {CXCL}14, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 were validated by immunohistochemistry (P {\textless} .001) as independent predictors of debulking status. The sum of immunohistochemistry intensities for these three proteins provided a tool that classified 92.8\% of samples correctly in high- and low-risk groups for suboptimal debulking (area under the curve = 0.89; 95\% {CI} = 0.84 to 0.93).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our survival signature provides the most accurate and validated prognostic model for early- and advanced-stage high-grade, serous ovarian cancer. The debulking signature accurately predicts the outcome of cytoreductive surgery, potentially allowing for stratification of patients for primary vs secondary cytoreduction.},

	abstract = {Although they have become a widely used experimental technique for identifying differentially expressed ({DE}) genes, {DNA} microarrays are notorious for generating noisy data. A common strategy for mitigating the effects of noise is to perform many experimental replicates. This approach is often costly and sometimes impossible given limited resources; thus, analytical methods are needed which increase accuracy at no additional cost. One inexpensive source of microarray replicates comes from prior work: to date, data from hundreds of thousands of microarray experiments are in the public domain. Although these data assay a wide range of conditions, they cannot be used directly to inform any particular experiment and are thus ignored by most {DE} gene methods. We present the {SVD} Augmented Gene expression Analysis Tool ({SAGAT}), a mathematically principled, data-driven approach for identifying {DE} genes. {SAGAT} increases the power of a microarray experiment by using observed coexpression relationships from publicly available microarray datasets to reduce uncertainty in individual genes' expression measurements. We tested the method on three well-replicated human microarray datasets and demonstrate that use of {SAGAT} increased effective sample sizes by as many as 2.72 arrays. We applied {SAGAT} to unpublished data from a microarray study investigating transcriptional responses to insulin resistance, resulting in a 50\% increase in the number of significant genes detected. We evaluated 11 (58\%) of these genes experimentally using {qPCR}, confirming the directions of expression change for all 11 and statistical significance for three. Use of {SAGAT} revealed coherent biological changes in three pathways: inflammation, differentiation, and fatty acid synthesis, furthering our molecular understanding of a type 2 diabetes risk factor. We envision {SAGAT} as a means to maximize the potential for biological discovery from subtle transcriptional responses, and we provide it as a freely available software package that is immediately applicable to any human microarray study.},

These patterns of tissue-specific expression are more accurate than existing high-throughput experimental studies for nearly all tissues; they also complement existing experiments by addressing tissue-specific expression present at particular developmental stages and in small tissues. We used these predictions to address several experimentally challenging questions, including the identification of tissue-specific transcriptional motifs and the discovery of potential {miRNA} regulation specific to particular tissues. We also investigate the role of tissue context in gene function through tissue-specific functional interaction networks.

To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging ({CS}-{BLI}) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. {CS}-{BLI} is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, {NF}-{kappaB}, {HIF}-1alpha, myc, {hTERT} and {IRF}4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, {CS}-{BLI} can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of {CS}-{BLI}, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.},

	abstract = {The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma ({EAC}) has risen 600\% over the last 30 years. With a 5-year survival rate of {\textasciitilde}15\%, the identification of new therapeutic targets for {EAC} is greatly important. We analyze the mutation spectra from whole-exome sequencing of 149 {EAC} tumor-normal pairs, 15 of which have also been subjected to whole-genome sequencing. We identify a mutational signature defined by a high prevalence of A{\textgreater}C transversions at {AA} dinucleotides. Statistical analysis of exome data identified 26 significantly mutated genes. Of these genes, five ({TP}53, {CDKN}2A, {SMAD}4, {ARID}1A and {PIK}3CA) have previously been implicated in {EAC}. The new significantly mutated genes include chromatin-modifying factors and candidate contributors {SPG}20, {TLR}4, {ELMO}1 and {DOCK}2. Functional analyses of {EAC}-derived mutations in {ELMO}1 identifies increased cellular invasion. Therefore, we suggest the potential activation of the {RAC}1 pathway as a contributor to {EAC} tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {Multiple factor analysis ({MFA}, also called multiple factorial analysis) is an extension of principal component analysis ({PCA}) tailored to handle multiple data tables that measure sets of variables collected on the same observations, or, alternatively, (in dual-{MFA}) multiple data tables where the same variables are measured on different sets of observations. {MFA} proceeds in two steps: First it computes a {PCA} of each data table and ‘normalizes’ each data table by dividing all its elements by the first singular value obtained from its {PCA}. Second, all the normalized data tables are aggregated into a grand data table that is analyzed via a (non-normalized) {PCA} that gives a set of factor scores for the observations and loadings for the variables. In addition, {MFA} provides for each data table a set of partial factor scores for the observations that reflects the specific ‘view-point’ of this data table. Interestingly, the common factor scores could be obtained by replacing the original normalized data tables by the normalized factor scores obtained from the {PCA} of each of these tables. In this article, we present {MFA}, review recent extensions, and illustrate it with a detailed example. {WIREs} Comput Stat 2013, 5:149–179. doi: 10.1002/wics.1246},

	abstract = {Macroautophagy (autophagy hereafter) is a catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular components in lysosomes. This cellular garbage disposal and intracellular recycling system maintains cellular homeostasis by eliminating superfluous or damaged proteins and organelles and invading microbes and by providing substrates for energy generation and biosynthesis in stress. Autophagy thus promotes the health of cells and animals and is critical for the development, differentiation, and maintenance of cell function and for the host defense against pathogens. Deregulation of autophagy is linked to susceptibility to various disorders including degenerative diseases, metabolic syndrome, aging, infectious diseases, and cancer. Autophagic activity emerges as a critical factor in the development and progression of diseases that are associated with increased cancer risk as well as in different stages of cancer. Given that cancer is a complex process and autophagy exerts its effects in multiple ways, the role of autophagy in tumorigenesis is context-dependent. As a cytoprotective survival pathway, autophagy prevents chronic tissue damage that can lead to cancer initiation and progression. In this setting, stimulation or restoration of autophagy may prevent cancer. In contrast, once cancer occurs, many cancer cells upregulate basal autophagy and utilize autophagy to enhance fitness and survive in the hostile tumor microenvironment. These findings revealed the concept that aggressive cancers can be addicted to autophagy for survival. In this setting, autophagy inhibition is a therapeutic strategy for established cancers.},

This investigation examines the composition of tumour-derived 'exosomes' and their effects on T lymphocytes. Membranous materials were isolated from ascites of ovarian cancer patients (n=6) and Western immunoblotting was performed for markers associated with 'exosomes.' Using cultured T cells, 'exosomes' were evaluated for suppression of {CD}3-zeta and {JAK} 3 expressions and induction of apoptosis, measured by {DNA} fragmentation. 'Exosome' components mediating suppression of {CD}3-zeta were isolated by continuous eluting electrophoresis and examined by Western immunoblotting. 'Exosomes' were shown to be identical with previously characterised shed membrane vesicles by protein staining and {TSG}101 expression. 'Exosomes' expressed class I {MHC}, placental alkaline phosphatase, B23/nucleophosmin, and {FasL}. 'Exosomes' suppressed expression of T-cell activation signalling components, {CD}3-zeta and {JAK} 3 and induced apoptosis. {CD}3-zeta suppression was mediated by two components: 26 and 42 {kDa}. Only the 42 {kDa} component reacted with anti-{FasL} antibody.

	abstract = {Widespread use of microarrays has generated large amounts of data, the interrogation of the public microarray repositories, identifying similarities between microarray experiments is now one of the major challenges. Approaches using defined group of genes, such as pathways and cellular networks (pathway analysis), have been proposed to improve the interpretation of microarray experiments. We propose a novel method to compare microarray experiments at the pathway level, this method consists of two steps: first, generate pathway signatures, a set of descriptors recapitulating the biologically meaningful pathways related to some clinical/biological variable of interest, second, use these signatures to interrogate microarray databases. We demonstrate that our approach provides more reliable results than with gene-based approaches. While gene-based approaches tend to suffer from bias generated by the analytical procedures employed, our pathway based method successfully groups together similar samples, independently of the experimental design. The results presented are potentially of great interest to improve the ability to query and compare experiments in public repositories of microarray data. As a matter of fact, this method can be used to retrieve data from public microarray databases and perform comparisons at the pathway level.},

	abstract = {Prostate cancers show a slow progression from a local lesion (primary tumor) to a metastatic and hormone-resistant phenotype. After an initial step of hyperplasia, in a high percentage of cases a neoplastic transformation event occurs that, less frequently, is followed by epithelial to mesenchymal transition and invasion of healthy tissues (usually bones). {MicroRNA}-203 ({miR}-203) is a tumor suppressor {microRNA} often silenced in different malignancies. Here, we show that {miR}-203 is downregulated in clinical primary prostatic tumors compared to normal prostate tissue, and in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal epithelial prostatic cells. Overexpression of {miR}-203 in brain or bone metastatic prostate cell lines ({DU}145 and {PC}3) is sufficient to induce a mesenchymal to epithelial transition with inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness. We have identified {CKAP}2, {LASP}1, {BIRC}5, {WASF}1, {ASAP}1 and {RUNX}2 as new {miR}-203 direct target {mRNAs} involved in these events.

	abstract = {Heterogeneity in sample composition is an inherent issue in many gene expression studies and, in many cases, should be taken into account in the downstream analysis to enable correct interpretation of the underlying biological processes. Typical examples are infectious diseases or immunology-related studies using blood samples, where, for example, the proportions of lymphocyte sub-populations are expected to vary between cases and controls. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization ({NMF}) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, notably in bioinformatics where its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays has been demonstrated. Very recently, it has been applied to biomarker discovery and gene expression deconvolution in heterogeneous tissue samples. Being essentially unsupervised, standard {NMF} methods are not guaranteed to find components corresponding to the cell types of interest in the sample, which may jeopardize the correct estimation of cell proportions. We have investigated the use of prior knowledge, in the form of a set of marker genes, to improve gene expression deconvolution with {NMF} algorithms. We found that this improves the consistency with which both cell type proportions and cell type gene expression signatures are estimated. The proposed method was tested on a microarray dataset consisting of pure cell types mixed in known proportions. Pearson correlation coefficients between true and estimated cell type proportions improved substantially (typically from about 0.5 to approximately 0.8) with the semi-supervised (marker-guided) versions of commonly used {NMF} algorithms. Furthermore known marker genes associated with each cell type were assigned to the correct cell type more frequently for the guided versions. We conclude that the use of marker genes improves the accuracy of gene expression deconvolution using {NMF} and suggest modifications to how the marker gene information is used that may lead to further improvements.},

One common goal of these studies is to determine which genes are differentially expressed between cancer and healthy tissue, or more generally, between two experimental conditions. A major complication in the molecular profiling of tumors using gene expression data is that the data represent a combination of tumor and normal cells. Much of the methodology developed for assessing differential expression with microarray data has assumed that tissue samples are homogeneous.Results: In this paper, we outline a general framework for determining differential expression in the presence of mixed cell populations. We consider study designs in which paired tissues and unpaired tissues are available. A hierarchical mixture model is used for modeling the data; a combination of methods of moments procedures and the expectation–maximization algorithm are used to estimate the model parameters. The finite-sample properties of the methods are assessed in simulation studies; they are applied to two microarray datasets from cancer studies.

p53 is a frequent target for mutation in human tumors, and mutant p53 proteins can actively contribute to tumorigenesis. We employed a three-dimensional culture model in which nonmalignant breast epithelial cells form spheroids reminiscent of acinar structures found in vivo, whereas breast cancer cells display highly disorganized morphology. We found that mutant p53 depletion is sufficient to phenotypically revert breast cancer cells to a more acinar-like morphology. Genome-wide expression analysis identified the mevalonate pathway as significantly upregulated by mutant p53. Statins and sterol biosynthesis intermediates reveal that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the phenotypic effects of mutant p53 on breast tissue architecture. Mutant p53 associates with sterol gene promoters at least partly via {SREBP} transcription factors. Finally, p53 mutation correlates with highly expressed sterol biosynthesis genes in human breast tumors. These findings implicate the mevalonate pathway as a therapeutic target for tumors bearing mutations in p53.},

	abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. This is attributed to frequent presentation at late stage, when the tumor has metastasized, as well as to development of chemotherapy resistance along tumor progression. Patients with advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma have widespread intraperitoneal metastases, including the formation of malignant serous effusions within the peritoneal cavity. Pleural effusions constitute the most frequent site of distant metastasis ({FIGO} stage {IV} disease). Unlike the majority of solid tumors, particularly at the primary site, cancer cells in effusions are not amenable to surgical removal, and failure in their eradication is one of the main causes of treatment failure. Our research in recent years has demonstrated that a large number of cancer-associated molecules are differentially expressed in effusions compared to primary carcinomas and solid metastases. We have additionally observed that expression of several of these molecules differs between primary diagnosis (pre-chemotherapy) and disease recurrence (post-chemotherapy) specimens, and that they are significantly associated with response to chemotherapy and patient survival. These observations are thought to be related to disease progression, as well as to the unique microenvironment of effusions, and may have impact on the selection of targeted therapy in this cancer. This review discusses our recent observations with respect to the biology of ovarian carcinoma cells in effusions, and focuses on the clinical role of tumor-associated molecules at this anatomic site.},

We found that, out of 87 well-characterized immune-related pre-{miRNAs}, 59 (67.82\%) are presented and enriched in breast milk exosomes (P {\textless} 10(-16), χ(2) test). In addition, compared with exogenous synthetic {miRNAs}, these endogenous immune-related {miRNAs} are more resistant to relatively harsh conditions. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that these exosomal {miRNAs} are transferred from the mother's milk to the infant via the digestive tract, and that they play a critical role in the development of the infant immune system.},

We performed a meta-analysis of gene expression profiles in data sets from eight independent patient cohorts across the world. In addition, aiming to establish the real world applicability of a classification system, we profiled 118 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from an additional patient cohort. A total of 603 patients were analyzed, representing the major etiologies of {HCC} (hepatitis B and C) collected from Western and Eastern countries. We observed three robust {HCC} subclasses (termed S1, S2, and S3), each correlated with clinical parameters such as tumor size, extent of cellular differentiation, and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. An analysis of the components of the signatures indicated that S1 reflected aberrant activation of the {WNT} signaling pathway, S2 was characterized by proliferation as well as {MYC} and {AKT} activation, and S3 was associated with hepatocyte differentiation. Functional studies indicated that the {WNT} pathway activation signature characteristic of S1 tumors was not simply the result of beta-catenin mutation but rather was the result of transforming growth factor-beta activation, thus representing a new mechanism of {WNT} pathway activation in {HCC}. These experiments establish the first consensus classification framework for {HCC} based on gene expression profiles and highlight the power of integrating multiple data sets to define a robust molecular taxonomy of the disease.},

Normal and cancer stem cells possess the ability to grow in vitro as self-renewing spheres, but the molecular basis of this phenotype remains largely unknown. We intended to establish a comprehensive culture system to grow prostatospheres ({PSs}) from both cancer cell lines and patient tumors. We then used gene expression microarrays to gain insight on the molecular pathways that sustain the {PS} tumor initiating cell ({TIC}) phenotype. {RESULTS}: Traditional stem cell medium ({SCM}) supplemented with {KnockoutSR} ({KO}) allows the propagation of monoclonal {PSs} from cell lines and primary cells. {PSs} display gene expression and tumorigenicity hallmarks of {TICs}. Gene expression analysis defined a gene signature composed of 66 genes that characterize {LNCaP} and patient {PSs}. This set includes novel prostate {TIC} growth factors ({NRP}1, {GDF}1, {JAG}1), proteins implicated in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal maintenance, transcriptional regulators ({MYCBP}, {MYBL}1, {ID}1, {ID}3, {FOS}, {ELF}3, {ELF}4, {KLF}2, {KLF}5) and factors involved in protein biosynthesis and metabolism. Meta-analysis in Oncomine reveals that some of these genes correlate with prostate cancer status and/or progression. Reporter genes and inhibitors indicate that the Notch pathway contributes to prostatosphere growth. {CONCLUSIONS}: We have developed a model for the culture of {PSs}, and provide a genomic profile that support {CSCs} identity. This signature identifies novel markers and pathways that are predicted to correlate with prostate cancer evolution.},

To further investigate the physiological function of {TSAP}6, we have generated {TSAP}6-deficient mice. These mice exhibit microcytic anemia with abnormal reticulocyte maturation and deficient transferrin receptor downregulation, a process known to be dependent on exosomal secretion. Moreover, we provide direct evidence that exosome production is severely compromised in {TSAP}6-null cells. Finally, we show that the {DNA} damage-induced p53-dependent nonclassical exosomal secretory pathway is abrogated in {TSAP}6-null cells. Given the fact that exosomes are used as cell-free vaccines against cancer and that they could be involved in the biogenesis and spread of human immunodeficiency virus, it is important to understand their regulation. The results presented here provide the first genetic demonstration that exosome formation is a tightly controlled biological process dependent of {TSAP}6.},

For hematopoietic malignancies, a classification scheme based on the phenotypic similarity between tumor cells and normal cells has been successfully used to define tumor subtypes; however, use of normal cell types as a reference by which to classify solid tumors has not been widely emulated, in part due to more limited understanding of epithelial cell differentiation compared with hematopoiesis. To provide a better definition of the subtypes of epithelial cells comprising the breast epithelium, we performed a systematic analysis of a large set of breast epithelial markers in more than 15,000 normal breast cells, which identified 11 differentiation states for normal luminal cells. We then applied information from this analysis to classify human breast tumors based on normal cell types into 4 major subtypes, {HR}0-{HR}3, which were differentiated by vitamin D, androgen, and estrogen hormone receptor ({HR}) expression. Examination of 3,157 human breast tumors revealed that these {HR} subtypes were distinct from the current classification scheme, which is based on estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Patient outcomes were best when tumors expressed all 3 hormone receptors (subtype {HR}3) and worst when they expressed none of the receptors (subtype {HR}0). Together, these data provide an ontological classification scheme associated with patient survival differences and provides actionable insights for treating breast tumors.},

Although cancer drug development traditionally focused on targeting the tumor cell cycle, emphasis has recently shifted toward the tumor microenvironment for novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic composite of cells broadly categorized as immune cells and nonimmune cells within a scaffold of extracellular matrix, where tumor cells thrive. Among the various nonimmune cell types, cancer stromal cells have emerged as critical players in promoting tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis as well as interacting with immune cells to tilt the equilibrium toward a tolerogenic environment that favors the tumor cells. In view of recent work that demonstrated that the depletion of fibroblast activation protein ({FAP}) expressing tumor stromal cells resulted in stunted tumor growth and improved response to tumor vaccination, the tumor microenvironment is, therefore, fertile ground for development of novel therapy with the potential of augmenting existing treatment and prevention options. In this review, we will focus on current evidence supporting the role of cancer associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}), with a special focus on {FAP}(+) stromal cells, in promoting tumor growth. The role of {CAFs} in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which may accelerate tumor progression, will be discussed with the hope that therapeutics developed to target the "generic" tumor microenvironment may be effective for malignancies such as triple negative breast cancer, for which targeted therapy is not available to date, in the future.},

However, the diversity of platforms has made it a challenge to re-use and/or integrate datasets generated in different experiments or labs for constructing array-based diagnostic models. Using large toxicogenomics datasets generated using both Affymetrix and Agilent microarray platforms, we carried out a benchmark evaluation of cross-platform consistency in multiple-class prediction using three widely-used machine learning algorithms. After an initial assessment of model performance on different platforms, we evaluated whether predictive signature features selected in one platform could be directly used to train a model in the other platform and whether predictive models trained using data from one platform could predict datasets profiled using the other platform with comparable performance. Our results established that it is possible to successfully apply multiple-class prediction models across different commercial microarray platforms, offering a number of important benefits such as accelerating the possible translation of biomarkers identified with microarrays to clinically-validated assays. However, this investigation focuses on a technical platform comparison and is actually only the beginning of exploring cross-platform consistency.

Thus, p53, its regulators and regulated genes form a complex p53 network which is composed of hundreds of genes and their products. {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) are a class of endogenously expressed, small non-coding {RNA} molecules which play a key role in regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Recent studies have demonstrated that {miRNAs} interact with p53 and its network at multiple levels. p53 regulates the transcription expression and the maturation of a group of {miRNAs}. On the other hand, {miRNAs} can regulate the activity and function of p53 through direct repression of p53 or its regulators in cells.

	abstract = {This paper concerns model selection for mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers ({MPCA}). The well known Bayesian information criterion ({BIC}) is frequently used for this purpose. However, it is found that {BIC} penalizes each analyzer implausibly using the whole sample size. In this paper, we present a new criterion for {MPCA} called hierarchical {BIC} in which each analyzer is penalized using its own effective sample size only. Theoretically, hierarchical {BIC} is a large sample approximation of variational Bayesian lower bound and {BIC} is a further approximation of hierarchical {BIC}. To learn hierarchical-{BIC}-based {MPCA}, we propose two efficient algorithms: two-stage and one-stage variants. The two-stage algorithm integrates model selection with respect to the subspace dimensions into parameter estimation, and the one-stage variant further integrates the selection of the number of mixture components into a single algorithm. Experiments on a number of synthetic and real-world data sets show that: 1) hierarchical {BIC} is more accurate than {BIC} and several related competitors and 2) the two proposed algorithms are not only effective but also much more efficient than the classical two-stage procedure commonly used for {BIC}.},

Unsupervised analysis in a prescreening set of 38 patients identified three subgroups predominantly driven by three {miRNA} signatures: an {ER}-driven luminal B-associated {miRNA} signature, a stromal {miRNA} signature, and an overexpressed {miRNA} cluster located on chromosome 19q23, but these intrinsic {miRNA} signatures were not associated with tumor aggressiveness. Supervised analysis in the initial subset and subsequent analysis in additional tumors significantly linked four {miRNAs} ({miR}-7, {miR}-128a, {miR}-210, and {miR}-516–3p) to {ER}+/{LNN} breast cancer aggressiveness (n = 147) and one {miRNA} ({miR}-210) to metastatic capability in {ER}−/{LNN} breast cancer (n = 114) and in the clinically important triple-negative subgroup (n = 69) (all P {\textless} 0.05). Bioinformatic analysis coupled {miR}-210 to hypoxia/{VEGF} signaling, {miR}-7 and {miR}-516–3p to cell cycle progression and chromosomal instability, and {miR}-128a to cytokine signaling.

Heterogeneous data integration remains a challenge, particularly due to noisy data sources, diversity of coverage, and functional biases. It is thus important to understand the behavior and robustness of data integration methods in the context of various biological functions. We focus on the ability of Bayesian networks to predict functional relationships between proteins under a variety of conditions. This study considers the effect of network structure and compares expert estimated conditional probabilities with those learned using a generative method (expectation maximization) and a discriminative method (extended logistic regression). We consider the contributions of individual data sources and interpret these results both globally and in the context of specific biological processes. We find that it is critical to consider variation across biological functions; even when global performance is strong, some categories are consistently predicted well, and others are difficult to analyze. All learned models outperform the equivalent expert estimated models, although this effect diminishes as the amount of available data decreases. These learning techniques are not specific to Bayesian networks, and thus our conclusions should generalize to other methods for data integration. Overall, Bayesian learning provides a consistent benefit in data integration, but its performance and the impact of heterogeneous data sources must be interpreted from the perspective of individual functional categories.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The normal functioning of a living cell is characterized by complex interaction networks involving many different types of molecules. Associations detected between diseases and perturbations in well-defined pathways within such interaction networks have the potential to illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and response to treatment.


{RESULTS}

In this paper, we present a computational method that compares expression profiles of genes in cancer samples to samples from normal tissues in order to detect perturbations of pre-defined pathways in the cancer. In contrast to many previous methods, our scoring function approach explicitly takes into account the interactions between the gene products in a pathway. Moreover, we compute the sub-pathway that has the highest score, as opposed to merely computing the score for the entire pathway. We use a permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the most perturbed sub-pathway. We apply our method to 20 pathways in the Netpath database and to the Global Cancer Map of gene expression in 18 cancers. We demonstrate that our method yields more sensitive results than alternatives that do not consider interactions or measure the perturbation of a pathway as a whole. We perform a sensitivity analysis to show that our approach is robust to modest changes in the input data. Our method confirms numerous well-known connections between pathways and cancers.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our results indicate that integrating differential gene expression with the interaction structure in a pathway is a powerful approach for detecting links between a cancer and the pathways perturbed in it. Our results also suggest that even well-studied pathways may be perturbed only partially in any given cancer. Further analysis of cancer-specific sub-pathways may shed new light on the similarities and differences between cancers.},

	abstract = {Summary
Cancer evolves dynamically as clonal expansions supersede one another driven by shifting selective pressures, mutational processes, and disrupted cancer genes. These processes mark the genome, such that a cancer's life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algorithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across a cancer's lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclonal diversification is prominent, and most mutations are found in just a fraction of tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representing more than 50\% of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the existence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of enabling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in a breast cancer's development, triggering diagnosis.

	doi = {10.1186/1741-7007-8-66},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Phylostratigraphy is a method used to correlate the evolutionary origin of founder genes (that is, functional founder protein domains) of gene families with particular macroevolutionary transitions. It is based on a model of genome evolution that suggests that the origin of complex phenotypic innovations will be accompanied by the emergence of such founder genes, the descendants of which can still be traced in extant organisms. The origin of multicellularity can be considered to be a macroevolutionary transition, for which new gene functions would have been required. Cancer should be tightly connected to multicellular life since it can be viewed as a malfunction of interaction between cells in a multicellular organism. A phylostratigraphic tracking of the origin of cancer genes should, therefore, also provide insights into the origin of multicellularity.


{RESULTS}

We find two strong peaks of the emergence of cancer related protein domains, one at the time of the origin of the first cell and the other around the time of the evolution of the multicellular metazoan organisms. These peaks correlate with two major classes of cancer genes, the 'caretakers', which are involved in general functions that support genome stability and the 'gatekeepers', which are involved in cellular signalling and growth processes. Interestingly, this phylogenetic succession mirrors the ontogenetic succession of tumour progression, where mutations in caretakers are thought to precede mutations in gatekeepers.


{CONCLUSIONS}

A link between multicellularity and formation of cancer has often been predicted. However, this has not so far been explicitly tested. Although we find that a significant number of protein domains involved in cancer predate the origin of multicellularity, the second peak of cancer protein domain emergence is, indeed, connected to a phylogenetic level where multicellular animals have emerged. The fact that we can find a strong and consistent signal for this second peak in the phylostratigraphic map implies that a complex multi-level selection process has driven the transition to multicellularity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women in the United States. During the advanced stages of disease, many breast cancer patients suffer from bone metastasis. These metastases are predominantly osteolytic and develop when tumor cells interact with bone. In vivo models that mimic the breast cancer-specific osteolytic bone microenvironment are limited. Previously, we developed a mouse model of tumor-bone interaction in which three mouse breast cancer cell lines were implanted onto the calvaria. Analysis of tumors from this model revealed that they exhibited strong bone resorption, induction of osteoclasts and intracranial penetration at the tumor bone ({TB})-interface.


{METHODS}

In this study, we identified and used a {TB} microenvironment-specific gene expression signature from this model to extend our understanding of the metastatic bone microenvironment in human disease and to predict potential therapeutic targets.


{RESULTS}

We identified a {TB} signature consisting of 934 genes that were commonly (among our 3 cell lines) and specifically (as compared to tumor-alone area within the bone microenvironment) up- and down-regulated {\textgreater}2-fold at the {TB} interface in our mouse osteolytic model. By comparing the {TB} signature with gene expression profiles from human breast metastases and an in vitro osteoclast model, we demonstrate that our model mimics both the human breast cancer bone microenvironment and osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we observed enrichment in various signaling pathways specific to the {TB} interface; that is, {TGF}-β and myeloid self-renewal pathways were activated and the Wnt pathway was inactivated. Lastly, we used the {TB}-signature to predict cyclopenthiazide as a potential inhibitor of the {TB} interface.


{CONCLUSION}

Our mouse breast cancer model morphologically and genetically resembles the osteoclastic bone microenvironment observed in human disease. Characterization of the gene expression signature specific to the {TB} interface in our model revealed signaling mechanisms operative in human breast cancer metastases and predicted a therapeutic inhibitor of cancer-mediated osteolysis.},

This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the {GWAS} provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary {GWAS} statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple {GWAS} to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides a way to combine associations across {GWAS}, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single {GWAS} study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact. Pathway analysis of {GWAS} results is used to prioritize genes and pathways within a biological context. Following a {GWAS}, association results can be assigned to pathways and tested in aggregate with computational tools and pathway databases.

Particularly in higher organisms, transcription factors ({TFs}), {microRNAs} and epigenetic modifications can combine to form a complex regulatory network. Part of this system can be modeled as a collection of regulatory modules: co-regulated genes, the conditions under which they are co-regulated and sequence-level regulatory motifs. {RESULTS}: We present the Combinatorial Algorithm for Expression and Sequence-based Cluster Extraction ({COALESCE}) system for regulatory module prediction. The algorithm is efficient enough to discover expression biclusters and putative regulatory motifs in metazoan genomes ({\textgreater}20,000 genes) and very large microarray compendia ({\textgreater}10,000 conditions). Using Bayesian data integration, it can also include diverse supporting data types such as evolutionary conservation or nucleosome placement. We validate its performance using a functional evaluation of co-clustered genes, known yeast and Escherichea coli {TF} targets, synthetic data and various metazoan data compendia. In all cases, {COALESCE} performs as well or better than current biclustering and motif prediction tools, with high accuracy in functional and {TF}/target assignments and zero false positives on synthetic data. {COALESCE} provides an efficient and flexible platform within which large, diverse data collections can be integrated to predict metazoan regulatory networks. {AVAILABILITY}: Source code (C++) is available at http://function.princeton.edu/sleipnir, and supporting data and a web interface are provided at http://function.princeton.edu/coalesce. {CONTACT}: ogt@cs.princeton.edu; hcoller@princeton.edu. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Somatic p53 tumour suppressor gene mutations in these tumours suggest a pathogenesis involving {DNA} damage, p53 mutation, and progressive loss of cell cycle control. We recently identified foci of strong p53 immunostaining-termed 'p53 signatures'-in benign tubal mucosa from {BRCA}+ women. To examine the relationship between p53 signatures and {TIC}, we compared location (fimbria vs ampulla), cell type (ciliated vs secretory), evidence of {DNA} damage, and p53 mutation status between the two entities. p53 signatures were equally common in non-neoplastic tubes from {BRCA}+ women and controls, but more frequently present (53\%) and multifocal (67\%) in fallopian tubes also containing {TIC}. Like prior studies of {TIC}, p53 signatures predominated in the fimbriae (80-100\%) and targeted secretory cells ({HMFG}2 + /p73-), with evidence of {DNA} damage by co-localization of gamma-H2AX. Laser-capture microdissected and polymerase chain reaction-amplified {DNA} revealed reproducible p53 mutations in eight of 14 fully-analysed p53 signatures and all of the 12 {TICs}; {TICs} and their associated ovarian carcinomas shared identical mutations. In one case, a contiguous p53 signature and {TIC} shared the same mutation. Morphological intermediates between the two, with p53 mutations and moderate proliferative activity, were also seen. This is the first report of an early and distinct alteration in non-neoplastic upper genital tract mucosa that fulfils many requirements for a precursor to pelvic serous cancer. The p53 signature and its malignant counterpart ({TIC}) underline the significance of the fimbria, both as a candidate site for serous carcinogenesis and as a target for future research on the early detection and prevention of this disease.},

Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples.

In silico dissection of mixed cell samples is essential for analyzing expression data generated in cancer studies. Currently, a systematic approach is lacking to address three challenges in computational deconvolution: (i) violation of linear addition of expression levels from multiple tissues when log-transformed microarray data are used; (ii) estimation of both tumor proportion and tumor-specific expression, when neither is known a priori; and (iii) estimation of expression profiles for individual patients.
{RESULTS}: We have developed a statistical method for deconvolving mixed cancer transcriptomes, {DeMix}, which addresses the aforementioned issues in array-based expression data. We demonstrate the performance of our model in synthetic and real, publicly available, datasets. {DeMix} can be applied to ongoing biomarker-based clinical studies and to the vast expression datasets previously generated from mixed tumor and stromal cell samples.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Ovarian cancer causes more than 15000 deaths per year in the United States. The survival of patients is quite heterogeneous, and accurate prognostic tools would help with the clinical management of these patients.
{METHODS}: We developed and validated two gene expression signatures, the first for predicting survival in advanced-stage, serous ovarian cancer and the second for predicting debulking status. We integrated 13 publicly available datasets totaling 1525 subjects. We trained prediction models using a meta-analysis variation on the compound covariable method, tested models by a "leave-one-dataset-out" procedure, and validated models in additional independent datasets. Selected genes from the debulking signature were validated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ({qRT}-{PCR}) in two further independent cohorts of 179 and 78 patients, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS}: The survival signature stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups (hazard ratio = 2.19; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 1.84 to 2.61) statistically significantly better than the {TCGA} signature (P = .04). {POSTN}, {CXCL}14, {FAP}, {NUAK}1, {PTCH}1, and {TGFBR}2 were validated by {qRT}-{PCR} (P {\textless} .05) and {POSTN}, {CXCL}14, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 were validated by immunohistochemistry (P {\textless} .001) as independent predictors of debulking status. The sum of immunohistochemistry intensities for these three proteins provided a tool that classified 92.8\% of samples correctly in high- and low-risk groups for suboptimal debulking (area under the curve = 0.89; 95\% {CI} = 0.84 to 0.93).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our survival signature provides the most accurate and validated prognostic model for early- and advanced-stage high-grade, serous ovarian cancer. The debulking signature accurately predicts the outcome of cytoreductive surgery, potentially allowing for stratification of patients for primary vs secondary cytoreduction.},

	abstract = {The majority of tumors arising in {BRCA}1 mutation carriers exhibit inactivation of p53, a key effector of cell death after {DNA} damage. Despite the loss of p53, {BRCA}1-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cisplatin, and patients with {BRCA}1-associated ovarian carcinomas experience improved outcomes with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with sporadic cases. Although it is known that chemosensitivity in {BRCA}1-associated cancers is associated with unrepaired {DNA} damage, the specific effector pathway mediating the cellular response to platinum-induced damage in these tumors is poorly understood. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73, encoding a proapoptotic protein that is linked to chemosensitivity in many settings, is upregulated through a novel epigenetic mechanism in both human and murine models of {BRCA}1-associated ovarian carcinoma. {BRCA}1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor {ZEB}1, leading to the abrogation of {ZEB}1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms ({TAp}73). Cisplatin chemotherapy induces {TAp}73 target genes specifically in {BRCA}1-deficient cells, and knockdown of {TAp}73 in these cells causes chemoresistance while having little or no effect on {BRCA}1-expressing tumor cells. In primary ovarian carcinomas, {ZEB}1 binding site methylation and {TAp}73 expression correlate with {BRCA}1 status and with clinical response. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism that supports the contribution of {TAp}73 as an important mediator of the response to platinum chemotherapy in a subset of ovarian carcinomas. {TAp}73 might represent a response predictor and potential therapeutic target for enhancing chemosensitivity in this disease.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0033233},
	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Expression and activity of the main lipogenic enzymes is paradoxically decreased in obesity, but the mechanisms behind these findings are poorly known. Breast Cancer 1 ({BrCa}1) interacts with acetyl-{CoA} carboxylase ({ACC}) reducing the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate {BrCa}1 in human adipose tissue according to obesity and insulin resistance, and in vitro cultured adipocytes.


{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}

{BrCa}1 gene expression, total and phosphorylated (P-) {BrCa}1, and {ACC} were analyzed in adipose tissue samples obtained from a total sample of 133 subjects. {BrCa}1 expression was also evaluated during in vitro differentiation of human adipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells.


{RESULTS}

{BrCa}1 gene expression was significantly up-regulated in both omental ({OM}; 1.36-fold, p = 0.002) and subcutaneous ({SC}; 1.49-fold, p = 0.001) adipose tissue from obese subjects. In parallel with increased {BrCa}1 {mRNA}, P-{ACC} was also up-regulated in {SC} (p = 0.007) as well as in {OM} (p = 0.010) fat from obese subjects. Consistent with its role limiting fatty acid biosynthesis, both {BrCa}1 {mRNA} (3.5-fold, p{\textless}0.0001) and protein (1.2-fold, p = 0.001) were increased in pre-adipocytes, and decreased during in vitro adipogenesis, while P-{ACC} decreased during differentiation of human adipocytes (p = 0.005) allowing lipid biosynthesis. Interestingly, {BrCa}1 gene expression in mature adipocytes was restored by inflammatory stimuli (macrophage conditioned medium), whereas lipogenic genes significantly decreased.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The specular findings of {BrCa}1 and lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue and adipocytes reported here suggest that {BrCa}1 might help to control fatty acid biosynthesis in adipocytes and adipose tissue from obese subjects.},

Due to the manual curation process, such databases are never up-to-date and tend to be limited in focus and coverage. Automated literature mining tools provide an attractive, alternative approach. We review how they can be employed for the interpretation of gene expression profiling experiments. We illustrate that their comprehensive scope aids the interpretation of data from domains poorly covered by {GO} or alternative databases, and allows for the linking of gene expression with diseases, drugs, tissues and other types of concepts. A framework for proper statistical evaluation of the associations between gene expression values and literature concepts was lacking and is now implemented in a weighted extension of global test. The weights are the literature association scores and reflect the importance of a gene for the concept of interest. In a direct comparison with classical {GO}-based gene sets, we show that use of literature-based associations results in the identification of much more specific {GO} categories. We demonstrate the possibilities for linking of gene expression data to patient survival in breast cancer and the action and metabolism of drugs. Coupling with online literature mining tools ensures transparency and allows further study of the identified associations. Literature mining tools are therefore powerful additions to the toolbox for the interpretation of high-throughput genomics data.},

Epithelial ovarian cancer ({EOC}) tends to metastasize to the peritoneal cavity where interactions within the microenvironment might lead to chemoresistance. Mesothelial cells are important actors of the peritoneal homeostasis; we determined their role in the acquisition of chemoresistance of ovarian tumours. {METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS} We isolated an original type of stromal cells, referred to as "Hospicells" from ascitis of patients with ovarian carcinosis using limiting dilution. We studied their ability to confer chemoresistance through heterocellular interactions. These stromal cells displayed a new phenotype with positive immunostaining for {CD}9, {CD}10, {CD}29, {CD}146, {CD}166 and Multi drug resistance protein. They preferentially interacted with epithelial ovarian cancer cells. This interaction induced chemoresistance to platin and taxans with the implication of multi-drug resistance proteins. This contact enabled {EOC} cells to capture patches of the Hospicells membrane through oncologic trogocytosis, therefore acquiring their functional P-gp proteins and thus developing chemoresistance. Presence of Hospicells on ovarian cancer tissue micro-array from patients with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was also significantly associated to chemoresistance. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE} This is the first report of trogocytosis occurring between a cancer cell and an original type of stromal cell. This interaction induced autonomous acquisition of chemoresistance. The presence of stromal cells within patient's tumour might be predictive of chemoresistance. The specific interaction between cancer cells and stromal cells might be targeted during chemotherapy.},

	title = {Proteomic analysis of exosome-like vesicles derived from breast cancer cells},
	volume = {32},
	issn = {1791-7530},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIM}: The phenomenon of membrane vesicle-release by neoplastic cells is a growing field of interest in cancer research, due to their potential role in carrying a large array of tumor antigens when secreted into the extracellular medium. In particular, experimental evidence show that at least some of the tumor markers detected in the blood circulation of mammary carcinoma patients are carried by membrane-bound vesicles. Thus, biomarker research in breast cancer can gain great benefits from vesicle characterization.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Conditioned medium was collected from serum starved {MDA}-{MB}-231 sub-confluent cell cultures and exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Ultrastructural analysis of {ELVs} was performed by transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) and the purity of fraction was confirmed by western blotting assays. Proteomic profile of {ELVs} was carried out by 2 D-{PAGE} and protein identification performed by {MALDI}-{ToF} Mass Spectrometry.
{RESULTS}: On the basis of ultrastructural and immunological characterization, the isolated vesicles have been classified as exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}). The proteomic investigation showed a distinctive protein profile of the {ELVs}, in comparison to the whole cell lisates ({WCL}) proteome, which could be instrumental for cancer progression. The proteins were clustered into functional categories, according to the current bioinformatics resources and a Venn diagram was constructed based on these clusters.
{CONCLUSION}: It is reasonable to assume that vesicle production allows neoplastic cells to exert different effects, according to the possible acceptor targets. For instance, vesicles could potentiate the malignant properties of adjacent neoplastic cells or activate non-tumoral cells. Moreover, vesicles could convey signals to immune cells and surrounding stroma cells. The present study may significantly contribute to the knowledge of the vesiculation phenomenon, which is a critical device for trans cellular communication in cancer.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION} Several authors have underscored a strong relation between the molecular subtypes and the axillary status of breast cancer patients. The aim of our work was to decipher the interaction between this classification and the probability of a positive sentinel node biopsy. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS} Our dataset consisted of a total number of 2654 early-stage breast cancer patients. Patients treated at first by conservative breast surgery plus sentinel node biopsies were selected. A multivariate logistic regression model was trained and validated. Interaction covariate between {ER} and {HER}2 markers was a forced input of this model. The performance of the multivariate model in the training and the two validation sets was analyzed in terms of discrimination and calibration. Probability of axillary metastasis was detailed for each molecular subtype. {RESULTS} The interaction covariate between {ER} and {HER}2 status was a stronger predictor (p = 0.0031) of positive sentinel node biopsy than the {ER} status by itself (p = 0.016). A multivariate model to determine the probability of sentinel node positivity was defined with the following variables; tumour size, lympho-vascular invasion, molecular subtypes and age at diagnosis. This model showed similar results in terms of discrimination ({AUC} = 0.72/0.73/0.72) and calibration ({HL} p = 0.28/0.05/0.11) in the training and validation sets. The interaction between molecular subtypes, tumour size and sentinel nodes status was approximated. {DISCUSSION} We showed that biologically-driven analyses are able to build new models with higher performance in terms of breast cancer axillary status prediction. The molecular subtype classification strongly interacts with the axillary and distant metastasis process.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Axillary lymph node involvement remains the most important prognostic factor in early-stage breast cancer. We hypothesized that molecular classification based on breast cancer biology would predict the presence of nodal involvement at diagnosis, which might aid treatment decisions regarding the axilla. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS} From a clinically annotated tissue microarray of 4444 early-stage breast cancers, expression of estrogen receptor ({ER}), progesterone receptor ({PgR}), {HER}2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and cytokeratin 5/6 was determined by immunohistochemistry. Cases were classified by published criteria into molecular subtypes of luminal, luminal/{HER}2 positive, {HER}2 positive/{ER} negative/{PgR} negative, and basal. Risk of axillary nodal involvement at diagnosis was determined in 2 multivariable logistic regression models: a "core biopsy model" including molecular subtype, age, grade, and tumor size and a "lumpectomy model," which also included lymphovascular invasion. Luminal was used as the reference group. After internal validation of findings in 2 independent sets, we conducted combined analysis of both. {RESULTS} In the core biopsy model, the molecular subtypes had a predictive effect for nodal involvement (P= .000001), with the basal subtype having an odds ratio for axillary lymph node involvement of 0.53 (95\% {CI}, 0.41-0.69). Tumor grade (P=5.43 x 10(-12)) and size (P=8.52 x 10(-35)) were also predictive for nodal involvement. Similar results were found in the lumpectomy model, where lymphovascular invasion was also predictive (P=2.74 x 10(-115)). {CONCLUSION} These results indicate that the basal breast cancer molecular subtype predicts a lower incidence of axillary nodal involvement, and including biomarker profiles to predict nodal status at diagnosis could help stratification for decisions regarding axillary surgery and locoregional radiation.},

We investigated the relevance, in {TNBC}, of nano-sized exosomes expelled from cells. Specifically, we compared effects of exosomes derived from the claudin-low {TNBC} cell line Hs578T and its more invasive Hs578Ts(i)8 variant, as well as exosomes from {TNBC} patient sera compared to normal sera.
{METHODS}: Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media ({CM}) of Hs578T and Hs578Ts(i)8 cells and from sera by filtration and ultracentrifugation. Successful isolation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Subsequent analysis, of secondary/recipient cells in response to exosomes, included proliferation; motility/migration; invasion; anoikis assays and endothelial tubule formation assays.
{RESULTS}: Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes versus Hs578T-exosomes significantly increased the proliferation, migration and invasion capacity of all three recipient cell lines evaluated i.e. {SKBR}3, {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {HCC}1954. Exosomes from Hs578Ts(i)8 cells also conferred increased invasiveness to parent Hs578T cells. Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes increased sensitivity of {SKBR}3, {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {HCC}1954 to anoikis when compared to the effects of Hs578T-exosomes reflecting the fact that Hs578Ts(i)8 cells are themselves innately more sensitive to anoikis. In relation to vasculogenesis and subsequent angiogenesis, Hs578Ts(i)8-exosomes versus Hs578T-exosomes stimulated significantly more endothelial tubules formation. Finally, our pilot translational study showed that exosomes from {TNBC} patients' sera significantly increased recipient cells' invasion when compared to those derived from age- and gender-matched healthy control sera.

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2011.37.8133},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Mutations in {BRCA}1/2 dramatically increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancers. Three mutations in these genes (185delAG, 5382insC, and 6174delT) occur at high frequency in Ashkenazi Jews. We evaluated how these common Jewish mutations ({CJMs}) affect cancer risks and risk reduction.
{METHODS}: Our cohort comprised 4,649 women with disease-associated {BRCA}1/2 mutations from 22 centers in the Prevention and Observation of Surgical End Points Consortium. Of these women, 969 were self-identified Jewish women. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate breast and ovarian cancer risks, as well as risk reduction from risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy ({RRSO}), by {CJM} and self-identified Jewish status.
{RESULTS}: Ninety-one percent of Jewish {BRCA}1/2-positive women carried a {CJM}. Jewish women were significantly more likely to undergo {RRSO} than non-Jewish women (54\% v 41\%, respectively; odds ratio, 1.87; 95\% {CI}, 1.44 to 2.42). Relative risks of cancer varied by {CJM}, with the relative risk of breast cancer being significantly lower in 6174delT mutation carriers than in non-{CJM} {BRCA}2 carriers (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95\% {CI}, 0.18 to 0.69). No significant difference was seen in cancer risk reduction after {RRSO} among subgroups.
{CONCLUSION}: Consistent with previous results, risks for breast and ovarian cancer varied by {CJM} in {BRCA}1/2 carriers. In particular, 6174delT carriers had a lower risk of breast cancer. This finding requires additional confirmation in larger prospective and population-based cohort studies before being integrated into clinical care.},

	abstract = {Estrogen imprinting is used to describe a phenomenon in which early developmental exposure to endocrine disruptors increases breast cancer risk later in adult life. We propose that long-lived, self-regenerating stem and progenitor cells are more susceptible to the exposure injury than terminally differentiated epithelial cells in the breast duct. Mammospheres, containing enriched breast progenitors, were used as an exposure system to simulate this imprinting phenomenon in vitro. Using {MeDIP}-chip, a methylation microarray screening method, we found that 0.5\% (120 loci) of human {CpG} islands were hypermethylated in epithelial cells derived from estrogen-exposed progenitors compared with the non-estrogen-exposed control cells. This epigenetic event may lead to progressive silencing of tumor suppressor genes, including {RUNX}3, in these epithelial cells, which also occurred in primary breast tumors. Furthermore, normal tissue in close proximity to the tumor site also displayed {RUNX}3 hypermethylation, suggesting that this aberrant event occurs in early breast carcinogenesis. The high prevalence of estrogen-induced epigenetic changes in primary tumors and the surrounding histologically normal tissues provides the first empirical link between estrogen injury of breast stem/progenitor cells and carcinogenesis. This finding also offers a mechanistic explanation as to why a tumor suppressor gene, such as {RUNX}3, can be heritably silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Periostin ({PN}), a secreted adhesion-related protein expressed in the periosteum and periodontal ligaments, acts as a critical regulator of the formation and maintenance of bone and teeth, and also plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Although {PN} is highly expressed in various types of human cancers, its function is still unclear. In this study, we focused on the exon 17 region of {PN}, which is alternatively spliced out. To investigate the function of full-length {PN} with exon 17, we produced a neutralizing antibody ({PN}1-Ab) against the peptide encoded by exon 17. In vivo, administration of {PN}1-Ab significantly inhibited the growth of primary tumors as well as metastatic tumors, associated with prevention of bone destruction, resulting in increased survival of mice. Consistent with in vivo data, the present in vitro study demonstrated that addition of full-length {PN} significantly inhibited cell adhesion and detached adherent cells, while {PN}1-Ab inhibited the action of {PN} in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, {PN}1-Ab significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells, which produced {PN}. Interestingly, {PN}1-Ab also inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts. Overall, the present study demonstrated that {PN} plays a pivotal role in the progression and metastasis of breast cancer. Since administration of {PN}1-Ab prolonged cell survival through inhibition of the progression and metastasis of 4T1 cells, further development of the {PN}1-Ab such as generation of a humanized antibody may provide a new therapeutic agent against breast cancer.},

More recently they were reported as vectors of {mRNAs}, {miRNAs} and also lipid mediators able to act on target cells. They are the only type of vesicles released from an intracellular compartment from cells in viable conditions. They appear as a vectorized signaling system operating from inside a donor cell towards either the periphery, the cytosol, or possibly to the nucleus of target cells. Exosomes from normal cells trigger positive effects, whereas those from pathological ones, such as tumor cells or infected ones may trigger non-positive health effects.

To determine the spectrum of {piRNA}-regulated targets that may extend beyond {TEs}, we conducted a genome-wide survey for transcripts associated with {PIWI} and for transcripts affected by {PIWI} knockdown in Drosophila ovarian somatic sheet ({OSS}) cells, a follicle cell line expressing the Piwi pathway. Despite the immense sequence diversity among {OSS} cell {piRNAs}, our analysis indicates that {TE} transcripts are the major transcripts associated with and directly regulated by {PIWI}. However, several coding genes were indirectly regulated by {PIWI} via an adjacent de novo {TE} insertion that generated a nascent {TE} transcript. Interestingly, we noticed that {PIWI}-regulated genes in {OSS} cells greatly differed from genes affected in a related follicle cell culture, ovarian somatic cells ({OSCs}). Therefore, we characterized the distinct genomic {TE} insertions across four {OSS} and {OSC} lines and discovered dynamic {TE} landscapes in gonadal cultures that were defined by a subset of active {TEs}. Particular de novo {TEs} appeared to stimulate the expression of novel candidate long noncoding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) in a cell lineage-specific manner, and some of these {TE}-associated {lncRNAs} were associated with {PIWI} and overlapped {PIWI}-regulated genes. Our analyses of {OSCs} and {OSS} cells demonstrate that despite having a Piwi pathway to suppress endogenous mobile elements, gonadal cell {TE} landscapes can still dramatically change and create transcriptome diversity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Several gene sets for prediction of breast cancer survival have been derived from whole-genome {mRNA} expression profiles. Here, we develop a statistical framework to explore whether combination of the information from such sets may improve prediction of recurrence and breast cancer specific death in early-stage breast cancers. Microarray data from two clinically similar cohorts of breast cancer patients are used as training (n = 123) and test set (n = 81), respectively. Gene sets from eleven previously published gene signatures are included in the study.


{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}

To investigate the relationship between breast cancer survival and gene expression on a particular gene set, a Cox proportional hazards model is applied using partial likelihood regression with an L2 penalty to avoid overfitting and using cross-validation to determine the penalty weight. The fitted models are applied to an independent test set to obtain a predicted risk for each individual and each gene set. Hierarchical clustering of the test individuals on the basis of the vector of predicted risks results in two clusters with distinct clinical characteristics in terms of the distribution of molecular subtypes, {ER}, {PR} status, {TP}53 mutation status and histological grade category, and associated with significantly different survival probabilities (recurrence: p = 0.005; breast cancer death: p = 0.014). Finally, principal components analysis of the gene signatures is used to derive combined predictors used to fit a new Cox model. This model classifies test individuals into two risk groups with distinct survival characteristics (recurrence: p = 0.003; breast cancer death: p = 0.001). The latter classifier outperforms all the individual gene signatures, as well as Cox models based on traditional clinical parameters and the Adjuvant! Online for survival prediction.


{CONCLUSION}

Combining the predictive strength of multiple gene signatures improves prediction of breast cancer survival. The presented methodology is broadly applicable to breast cancer risk assessment using any new identified gene set.},

We aimed to longitudinally evaluate morphology and size of organoids in 3D co-cultures of normal ({MCF}10A) or pre-malignant ({MCF}10DCIS.com) {MEC} and {hTERT}-immortalized fibroblasts from reduction mammoplasty ({RMF}). This co-culture model, based on an isogenic panel of cell lines, can yield insights to understand breast cancer progression. However, 3D cultures pose challenges for quantitative assessment and imaging, especially when the goal is to measure the same organoid structures over time. Using optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) as a non-invasive method to longitudinally quantify morphological changes, we found that {OCT} provides excellent visualization of {MEC}-fibroblast co-cultures as they form ductal acini and remodel over time. Different concentrations of fibroblasts and {MEC} reflecting reported physiological ratios [1] were evaluated, and we found that larger, hollower, and more aspherical acini were formed only by pre-malignant {MEC} ({MCF}10DCIS.com) in the presence of fibroblasts, whereas in comparable conditions, normal {MEC} ({MCF}10A) acini remained smaller and less aspherical. The ratio of fibroblast to {MEC} was also influential in determining organoid phenotypes, with higher concentrations of fibroblasts producing more aspherical structures in {MCF}10DCIS.com. These findings suggest that stromal-epithelial interactions between fibroblasts and {MEC} can be modeled in vitro, with {OCT} imaging as a convenient means of assaying time dependent changes, with the potential for yielding important biological insights about the differences between benign and pre-malignant cells.},

The modulation of signaling via coinhibitory or costimulatory receptors expressed on T cells has proven to be a potent way to amplify antitumor immune responses. This approach has been exploited successfully for the generation of a new class of anticancer therapies, “checkpoint-blocking” antibodies, exemplified by the recently {FDA}-approved agent, ipilimumab, an antibody that blocks the coinhibitory receptor {CTLA}-4.

{METHODS}: Implants were formed from porous, biocompatible silk scaffolds seeded with full length {TRAIL}-expressing {MSCs} ({FLT}-{MSCs}). under a doxycycline inducible promoter. In vitro studies with {FLT}-{MSCs} demonstrated {TRAIL} expression and antitumor effects on breast cancer cells.

{RESULTS}: In vitro cell-specific bioluminescent imaging measured tumor cell specific growth in the presence of stromal cells and demonstrated {FLT}-{MSC} inhibition of breast cancer growth. {FLT}-{MSC} implants successfully decreased bone and lung metastasis, whereas liver metastasis decreased only with tail vein and co-injection administration routes.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The analysis of high-throughput gene expression data with respect to sets of genes rather than individual genes has many advantages. A variety of methods have been developed for assessing the enrichment of sets of genes with respect to differential expression. In this paper we provide a comparative study of four of these methods: Fisher's exact test, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA}), Random-Sets ({RS}), and Gene List Analysis with Prediction Accuracy ({GLAPA}). The first three methods use associative statistics, while the fourth uses predictive statistics. We first compare all four methods on simulated data sets to verify that Fisher's exact test is markedly worse than the other three approaches. We then validate the other three methods on seven real data sets with known genetic perturbations and then compare the methods on two cancer data sets where our a priori knowledge is limited.


{RESULTS}

The simulation study highlights that none of the three method outperforms all others consistently. {GSEA} and {RS} are able to detect weak signals of deregulation and they perform differently when genes in a gene set are both differentially up and down regulated. {GLAPA} is more conservative and large differences between the two phenotypes are required to allow the method to detect differential deregulation in gene sets. This is due to the fact that the enrichment statistic in {GLAPA} is prediction error which is a stronger criteria than classical two sample statistic as used in {RS} and {GSEA}. This was reflected in the analysis on real data sets as {GSEA} and {RS} were seen to be significant for particular gene sets while {GLAPA} was not, suggesting a small effect size. We find that the rank of gene set enrichment induced by {GLAPA} is more similar to {RS} than {GSEA}. More importantly, the rankings of the three methods share significant overlap.


{CONCLUSION}

The three methods considered in our study recover relevant gene sets known to be deregulated in the experimental conditions and pathologies analyzed. There are differences between the three methods and {GSEA} seems to be more consistent in finding enriched gene sets, although no method uniformly dominates over all data sets. Our analysis highlights the deep difference existing between associative and predictive methods for detecting enrichment and the use of both to better interpret results of pathway analysis. We close with suggestions for users of gene set methods.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: High-grade serous cancer ({HGSC}) is the most common cancer of the ovary and is characterized by chromosomal instability. Defects in homologous recombination repair ({HRR}) are associated with genomic instability in {HGSC}, and are exploited by therapy targeting {DNA} repair. Defective {HRR} causes uniparental deletions and loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}). Our purpose is to profile {LOH} in {HGSC} and correlate our findings to clinical outcome, and compare {HGSC} and high-grade breast cancers.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We examined {LOH} and copy number changes using single nucleotide polymorphism array data from three {HGSC} cohorts and compared results to a cohort of high-grade breast cancers. The {LOH} profiles in {HGSC} were matched to chemotherapy resistance and progression-free survival ({PFS}).
{RESULTS}: {LOH}-based clustering divided {HGSC} into two clusters. The major group displayed extensive {LOH} and was further divided into two subgroups. The second group contained remarkably less {LOH}. {BRCA}1 promoter methylation was associated with the major group. {LOH} clusters were reproducible when validated in two independent {HGSC} datasets. {LOH} burden in the major cluster of {HGSC} was similar to triple-negative, and distinct from other high-grade breast cancers. Our analysis revealed an {LOH} cluster with lower treatment resistance and a significant correlation between {LOH} burden and {PFS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Separating {HGSC} by {LOH}-based clustering produces remarkably stable subgroups in three different cohorts. Patients in the various {LOH} clusters differed with respect to chemotherapy resistance, and the extent of {LOH} correlated with {PFS}. {LOH} burden may indicate vulnerability to treatment targeting {DNA} repair, such as {PARP}1 inhibitors.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Clustering is a useful exploratory technique for the analysis of gene expression data. Many different heuristic clustering algorithms have been proposed in this context. Clustering algorithms based on probability models offer a principled alternative to heuristic algorithms. In particular, model-based clustering assumes that the data is generated by a finite mixture of underlying probability distributions such as multivariate normal distributions. The issues of selecting a 'good' clustering method and determining the 'correct' number of clusters are reduced to model selection problems in the probability framework. Gaussian mixture models have been shown to be a powerful tool for clustering in many applications.
{RESULTS}: We benchmarked the performance of model-based clustering on several synthetic and real gene expression data sets for which external evaluation criteria were available. The model-based approach has superior performance on our synthetic data sets, consistently selecting the correct model and the number of clusters. On real expression data, the model-based approach produced clusters of quality comparable to a leading heuristic clustering algorithm, but with the key advantage of suggesting the number of clusters and an appropriate model. We also explored the validity of the Gaussian mixture assumption on different transformations of real data. We also assessed the degree to which these real gene expression data sets fit multivariate Gaussian distributions both before and after subjecting them to commonly used data transformations. Suitably chosen transformations seem to result in reasonable fits.

The aim of the study was to investigate the association between the molecular subtypes and patterns of distant recurrence in patients with breast cancer.
{METHODS}: In an investigation of 313 women with breast cancer who underwent surgery from 1994 and 2000, the expressions of estrogen and progestrone receptor ({ER}/{PR}), and human epithelial receptor-2 ({HER}2) were evaluated. The subtypes were defined as luminal-A, luminal-{HER}2, {HER}2-enriched, and triple negative breast cancer ({TNBC}) according to {ER}, {PR}, and {HER}2 status.
{RESULTS}: Bone was the most common site of distant recurrence. The incidence of first distant recurrence site was significantly different among the subtypes. Brain metastasis was more frequent in the luminal-{HER}2 and {TNBC} subtypes. In subgroup analysis, overall survival in patients with distant recurrence after 24 months after surgery was significantly different among the subtypes.

In this article, we present {STATIS}, explain the criteria that it optimizes, review the recent inferential extensions to {STATIS} and illustrate it with a detailed example.We also review, and present in a common framework, the main developments of {STATIS} such as (1) X-{STATIS} or partial triadic analysis ({PTA}) which is used when all data tables collect the same variables measured on the same observations (e.g., at different times or locations), (2) {COVSTATIS}, which handles multiple covariance matrices collected on the same observations, (3) {DISTATIS}, which handles multiple distance matrices collected on the same observations and generalizes metric multidimensional scaling to three way distance matrices, (4) Canonical-{STATIS} ({CANOSTATIS}), which generalizes discriminant analysis and combines it with {DISTATIS} to analyze multitable discriminant analysis problems, (5) power-{STATIS}, which uses alternative criteria to find {STATIS} optimal weights, (6) {ANISOSTATIS}, which extends {STATIS} to give specific weights to each variable rather than to each whole table, (7) (K + 1)-{STATIS} (or external-{STATIS}), which extends {STATIS} (and {PLS}-methods and Tucker inter battery analysis) to the analysis of the relationships of several data sets and one external data set, and (8) double-{STATIS} (or {DO}-{ACT}), which generalizes (K + 1)-{STATIS} and analyzes two sets of data tables, and {STATIS}-4, which generalizes double-{STATIS} to more than two sets of data.These recent developments are illustrated by small examples. {WIREs} Comput Stat 2012, 4:124–167. doi: 10.1002/wics.198For further resources related to this article, please visit the {WIREs} website},

	abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer is a leading cause of female cancer mortality in the United States. In contrast to other women-specific cancers, like breast and uterine carcinomas, where death rates have fallen in recent years, ovarian cancer cure rates have remained relatively unchanged over the past two decades (1). This is largely due to the lack of appropriate screening tools for detection of early stage disease where surgery and chemotherapy are most effective (2, 3). As a result, most patients present with advanced stage disease and diffuse abdominal involvement. This is further complicated by the fact that ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multiple histologic subtypes (4, 5). Serous ovarian carcinoma ({SOC}) is the most common and aggressive subtype and the form most often associated with mutations in the {BRCA} genes. Current experimental models in this field involve the use of cancer cell lines and mouse models to better understand the initiating genetic events and pathogenesis of disease (6, 7). Recently, the fallopian tube has emerged as a novel site for the origin of {SOC}, with the fallopian tube ({FT}) secretory epithelial cell ({FTSEC}) as the proposed cell of origin (8, 9). There are currently no cell lines or culture systems available to study the {FT} epithelium or the {FTSEC}. Here we describe a novel ex vivo culture system where primary human {FT} epithelial cells are cultured in a manner that preserves their architecture, polarity, immunophenotype, and response to physiologic and genotoxic stressors. This ex vivo model provides a useful tool for the study of {SOC}, allowing a better understanding of how tumors can arise from this tissue, and the mechanisms involved in tumor initiation and progression.},

Whites had higher incidence rates than blacks after age 40 years, but the reverse was true among younger women (black-white crossover). Among younger women, the rate per 100,000 woman-years was 16.8 for black vs 15.1 for white women; the highest black-white incidence rate ratio ({IRR}) was seen among women younger than 30 years ({IRR} = 1.52, 95\% confidence interval = 1.34 to 1.73). This risk pattern was not observed in other ethnic groups. The black-white crossover among younger women was largely restricted to breast cancers with favorable tumor characteristics. The annual percentage change in the incidence of invasive breast cancers decreased modestly among older women but increased among younger ({\textless}40 years) white women. Continued surveillance of trends is needed, particularly for molecular subtypes that preferentially occur among young women.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The altered composition of immune cells in peripheral blood has been reported to be associated with cancer patient survival. However, analysis of the composition of peripheral immune cells are often limited in retrospective survival studies employing banked blood specimens with long-term follow-up because the application of flow cytometry to such specimens is problematic. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of deconvolving blood-based gene expression profiles ({GEPs}) to estimate the proportions of immune cells and determine their prognostic values for cancer patients.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Here, using {GEPs} from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) of 108 non-small cell lung cancer ({NSCLC}) patients, we deconvolved the immune cell proportions and analyzed their association with patient survival. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a low proportion of T cells was significantly associated with poor patient survival, as was the proportion of T helper cells; however, only the proportion of T cells was independently prognostic for patients by a multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio = 2.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.01-4.92; p = .048). Considering that altered peripheral blood compositions can reflect altered immune responses within the tumor microenvironment, based on a tissue-based {GEPs} of {NSCLC} patients, we demonstrated a significant association between poor patient survival and the low level of antigen presentation, which play a critical role in T cell proliferation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results demonstrate that it is feasible to deconvolve {GEPs} from banked blood specimens for retrospective survival analysis of alterations of immune cell composition, and suggest the proportion of T cells in {PBMC} which might reflect the antigen presentation level within the tumor microenvironment can be a prognostic marker for {NSCLC} patients.},

During 8.7 million person-years of follow-up, 17 923 ductal, 3332 lobular, 1062 tubular, 944 mixed ductal lobular, 330 mucinous and 117 medullary cancers were diagnosed. The effect of both age at menarche and age at first birth was greatest for lobular tumours; relative risks per 5-year increase in age at menarche for ductal, lobular, and tubular cancers were 0.93 (0.87-0.99), 0.65 (0.56-0.76), and 0.75 (0.57-0.98), respectively (P-value for heterogeneity=0.0001); and the relative risks per 5-year increase in age at first birth were 1.10 (1.07-1.12), 1.23 (1.17-1.29), and 1.13 (1.03-1.23), respectively (P-value for heterogeneity=0.0006). Increasing parity reduced the risk of each tumour type, except medullary cancers, but the reduction in risk was greater for mucinous cancers than for any other subtype considered (P{\textless}0.05 for comparison with each other subtype in turn). The effect of menopause did not vary significantly by tumour histology.

To gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms for the metabolic alterations induced by intake of hydrolysed casein, we performed an exploratory investigation using proton {NMR} spectroscopy, multi-block {PCA} ({MBPCA}) and a multi-compartment model including analyses of plasma, urine, faeces and tissue samples from mice fed diets with intact or hydrolysed casein and 16 or 32 energy\% protein. The {MBPCA} superscores showed a clear separation between samples from mice fed intact and hydrolysed casein diets, respectively. Block loadings revealed that fecal fat content was higher, and tissue and plasma lipid levels were lower in mice fed hydrolysed casein diets compared with mice fed intact casein. Amino acid metabolism was also altered by dietary protein form, and levels of branched-chain amino acids were higher in faeces and urine and lower in plasma and spleen in mice fed hydrolysed protein. Moreover, hepatic levels of the sulphur-containing metabolites taurine and glutathione were increased in mice fed hydrolysed casein, and hepatic glycogen amount was increased in mice fed hydrolysed casein. In contrast, the levels of glucose and its metabolite lactate were reduced in faeces, liver and plasma. Taken together, {NMR}-based metabolomic analyses indicated that pathways within lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism were altered by intake of hydrolysed casein, and that these alterations are likely to be underlying mechanisms for the observed prevention against diet-induced obesity associated with hydrolysed casein intake.},

We propose that long-lived, self-regenerating stem and progenitor cells are more susceptible to the exposure injury than terminally differentiated epithelial cells in the breast duct. Mammospheres, containing enriched breast progenitors, were used as an exposure system to simulate this imprinting phenomenon in vitro. Using {MeDIP}-chip, a methylation microarray screening method, we found that 0.5\% (120 loci) of human {CpG} islands were hypermethylated in epithelial cells derived from estrogen-exposed progenitors compared with the non-estrogen-exposed control cells. This epigenetic event may lead to progressive silencing of tumor suppressor genes, including {RUNX}3, in these epithelial cells, which also occurred in primary breast tumors. Furthermore, normal tissue in close proximity to the tumor site also displayed {RUNX}3 hypermethylation, suggesting that this aberrant event occurs in early breast carcinogenesis. The high prevalence of estrogen-induced epigenetic changes in primary tumors and the surrounding histologically normal tissues provides the first empirical link between estrogen injury of breast stem/progenitor cells and carcinogenesis. This finding also offers a mechanistic explanation as to why a tumor suppressor gene, such as {RUNX}3, can be heritably silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In the context of systems biology, few sparse approaches have been proposed so far to integrate several data sets. It is however an important and fundamental issue that will be widely encountered in post genomic studies, when simultaneously analyzing transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data using different platforms, so as to understand the mutual interactions between the different data sets. In this high dimensional setting, variable selection is crucial to give interpretable results. We focus on a sparse Partial Least Squares approach ({sPLS}) to handle two-block data sets, where the relationship between the two types of variables is known to be symmetric. Sparse {PLS} has been developed either for a regression or a canonical correlation framework and includes a built-in procedure to select variables while integrating data. To illustrate the canonical mode approach, we analyzed the {NCI}60 data sets, where two different platforms ({cDNA} and Affymetrix chips) were used to study the transcriptome of sixty cancer cell lines.
{RESULTS}: We compare the results obtained with two other sparse or related canonical correlation approaches: {CCA} with Elastic Net penalization ({CCA}-{EN}) and Co-Inertia Analysis ({CIA}). The latter does not include a built-in procedure for variable selection and requires a two-step analysis. We stress the lack of statistical criteria to evaluate canonical correlation methods, which makes biological interpretation absolutely necessary to compare the different gene selections. We also propose comprehensive graphical representations of both samples and variables to facilitate the interpretation of the results.
{CONCLUSION}: {sPLS} and {CCA}-{EN} selected highly relevant genes and complementary findings from the two data sets, which enabled a detailed understanding of the molecular characteristics of several groups of cell lines. These two approaches were found to bring similar results, although they highlighted the same phenomenons with a different priority. They outperformed {CIA} that tended to select redundant information.},

	abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal type of gynecologic malignancy. Sixty percent of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer present with advanced-stage disease that involves the peritoneal cavity and these patients have a 5-year survival rate of less than 30\%. For more than two decades, tumor-debulking surgery followed by platinum-taxane combination chemotherapy has remained the conventional first-line treatment of ovarian cancer. Although the initial response rate is 70\%-80\%, most patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer eventually relapse and succumb to recurrent chemoresistant disease. A number of molecular aberrations that drive tumor progression have been identified in ovarian cancer cells and intensive efforts have focused on developing therapeutic agents that target these aberrations. However, increasing evidence indicates that reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and various types of stromal cells also play important roles in driving ovarian tumor progression and that these stromal cells represent attractive therapeutic targets. Unlike tumor cells, stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment are in general genetically stable and are therefore less likely to become resistant to therapy. This concise review discusses the biological significance of the cross-talk between ovarian cancer cells and three major types of stromal cells (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages) and the development of new-generation therapies that target the ovarian tumor microenvironment.},

{METHODS}: Plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} were obtained by differential centrifugation of blood samples. {MV} number was evaluated by {BD} {TruCOUNT} Tubes ({BD} Biosciences). {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins were analyzed by Western blot.
{RESULTS}: {MV} number in plasma fractions enriched with {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} is higher in breast cancer patients with stages I-{IV} as well as with T2-T4 tumors, in comparison to control group.

Secondly, {TOP}2A expression was found significantly associated with cell proliferation, and with the highly proliferative Luminal B, Her2-enriched and Basal-like intrinsic subtypes. In conclusion, {TOP}2A expression in breast cancer was associated with high proliferation and aggressive tumor subtypes and appears to be independent of its amplification status. All of these features should be taken into consideration when assessing the predictive value of {TOP}2A for anthracycline-based chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {Most patients with {BRAF}(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective {RAF} kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to {RAF} inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 45 patients with {BRAF}(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative {RAF} inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients (51\%). Besides previously characterized alterations, we discovered a "long tail" of new mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) pathway alterations ({MAP}2K2, {MITF}) that confer {RAF} inhibitor resistance. In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same tumor biopsy. Overall, {RAF} inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving {MAPK} pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of {BRAF}(V600)-mutant melanoma. Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance studies.},

We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

It is often convenient to have a single simple number characterizing the relationship between pairs of such high-dimensional datasets in a comprehensive way. Matrix correlations are such numbers and are appealing since they can be interpreted in the same way as Pearson's correlations familiar to biologists. The high-dimensionality of functional genomics data is, however, problematic for existing matrix correlations. The motivation of this article is 2-fold: (i) we introduce the idea of matrix correlations to the bioinformatics community and (ii) we give an improvement of the most promising matrix correlation coefficient (the {RV}-coefficient) circumventing the problems of high-dimensional data. The modified {RV}-coefficient can be used in high-dimensional data analysis studies as an easy measure of common information of two datasets. This is shown by theoretical arguments, simulations and applications to two real-life examples from functional genomics, i.e. a transcriptomics and metabolomics example.

With clinical trial design and treatment of ovarian cancer increasingly based on histological and molecular characteristics, {PARP} inhibitors are on the horizon of becoming the first biologic agents to be used to treat ovarian cancer based upon pre-selection characteristics of the patient's cancer. {PARP} inhibitors are most active in ovarian cancers that have defects or aberrations in {DNA} repair; use of these agents has been of particular interest in high grade serous cancers ({HGSC}), where studies have shown that {\textasciitilde}50\% of {HGSC} have abnormalities of {DNA} repair through {BRCA} germline and somatic mutation, post-translational changes of {BRCA}, and abnormalities of other {DNA} repair molecules. In addition, as aberrant {DNA} pathways in other histological subtypes of ovarian cancer are identified, and through the combination of {PARP} inhibitors with other biologic agents, the pool of eligible patients who may benefit from {PARP} inhibitors will likely expand.

Placental mesenchymal stem cells ({pMSC}) are known to release paracrine factors (some of which are contained within exosomes) that promote angiogenesis and cell migration. The aims of this study were: to determine the effects of oxygen tension on the release of exosomes from {pMSC}; and to establish the effects of {pMSC}-derived exosomes on the migration and angiogenic tube formation of placental microvascular endothelial cells ({hPMEC}). {pMSC} were isolated from placental villi (8–12 weeks of gestation, n = 6) and cultured under an atmosphere of 1\%, 3\% or 8\% O2. Cell-conditioned media were collected and exosomes (exo-{pMSC}) isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. The dose effect (5–20 µg exosomal protein/ml) of {pMSC}-derived exosomes on {hPMEC} migration and tube formation were established using a real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™). The exosome pellet was resuspended in {PBS} and protein content was established by mass spectrometry ({MS}). Protein function and canonical pathways were identified using the {PANTHER} program and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, respectively. Exo-{pMSC} were identified, by electron microscopy, as spherical vesicles, with a typical cup-shape and diameters around of 100 nm and positive for exosome markers: {CD}63, {CD}9 and {CD}81. Under hypoxic conditions (1\% and 3\% O2) exo-{pMSC} released increased by 3.3 and 6.7 folds, respectively, when compared to the controls (8\% O2; p{\textless}0.01). Exo-{pMSC} increased {hPMEC} migration by 1.6 fold compared to the control (p{\textless}0.05) and increased {hPMEC} tube formation by 7.2 fold (p{\textless}0.05). {MS} analysis identified 390 different proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, development, immunomodulatory, and cell-to-cell communication.

Our goal was to determine whether presenting features of tumors differ among molecular subtypes. {METHODS} Subtypes were classified by immunohistochemical surrogates as luminal A (estrogen receptor [{ER}] and/or progesterone receptor [{PR}] positive, {HER}-2-), luminal B ({ER} and/or {PR}+, {HER}-2+), {HER}-2 ({ER} and {PR}-, {HER}-2+), or basal ({ER}, {PR}, {HER}-2-). Data were obtained from an established, registered database of patients with invasive breast cancer treated at our institution between January 1998 and June 2007. A total of 6,072 tumors were classifiable into molecular subtypes. The chi(2) test, analysis of variance, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to determine associations between subtype and clinicopathologic variables. {RESULTS} The distribution of subtypes was luminal A, 71\%; luminal B, 8\%; {HER}-2, 6\%; and basal, 15\%. Marked differences in age, tumor size, extent of lymph node involvement, nuclear grade, multicentric/multifocal disease, lymphovascular invasion ({LVI}), and extensive intraductal component were observed among subtypes. When compared with luminal A tumors, those overexpressing {HER}-2 (luminal B, {HER}-2) were significantly more likely to manifest nodal involvement, multifocal, extensive intraductal component, and {LVI} (P {\textless} 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, after controlling for patient age, tumor size, {LVI}, and nuclear grade, {HER}-2 subtype tumors were 2.0 times more likely to have four or more metastatic lymph nodes (P {\textless} 0.0001) and 1.6 times more likely to have multifocal disease (P {\textless} 0.0001) compared with patients with luminal A. {CONCLUSIONS} Tumor presentation varies among molecular subtypes; this information may be useful in selecting local therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy and lymph nodes evaluation before surgery or neoadjuvant therapy are likely to be beneficial in {HER}-2-overexpressing tumors.},

Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In {MDA}-{MB}231 highly represented genes downregulated by {CAF} derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between {ER} and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of {MCF}10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While {NAF} downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in {MDA}-{MB}231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in {MCF}10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. {NAFs} responded to coculture with {MDA}-{MB}231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by {TGFbeta}1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in {NAFs} gene expression profile influenced by {MCF}10A. {CAFs} responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene expression signatures have proven to be useful tools in many cancers to identify distinct subtypes of disease based on molecular features that drive pathogenesis, and to aid in predicting clinical outcomes. However, there are no current signatures for kidney cancer that are applicable in a clinical setting.
{OBJECTIVE}: To generate a signature biomarker for the clear cell renal cell carcinoma ({ccRCC}) good risk ({ccA}) and poor risk ({ccB}) subtype classification that could be readily applied to clinical samples to develop an integrated model for biologically defined risk stratification.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: A set of 72 {ccRCC} sample standards was used to develop a 34-gene classifier ({ClearCode}34) for assigning {ccRCC} tumors to subtypes. The classifier was applied to {RNA}-sequencing data from 380 nonmetastatic {ccRCC} samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), and to 157 formalin-fixed clinical samples collected at the University of North Carolina.
{OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {STATISTICAL} {ANALYSIS}: Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed on the individual cohorts to calculate recurrence-free survival ({RFS}), cancer-specific survival ({CSS}), and overall survival ({OS}). Training and test sets were randomly selected from the combined cohorts to assemble a risk prediction model for disease recurrence.
{RESULTS} {AND} {LIMITATIONS}: The subtypes were significantly associated with {RFS} (p{\textless}0.01), {CSS} (p{\textless}0.01), and {OS} (p{\textless}0.01). Hazard ratios for subtype classification were similar to those of stage and grade in association with recurrence risk, and remained significant in multivariate analyses. An integrated molecular/clinical model for {RFS} to assign patients to risk groups was able to accurately predict {CSS} above established, clinical risk-prediction algorithms.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {ClearCode}34-based model provides prognostic stratification that improves upon established algorithms to assess risk for recurrence and death for nonmetastatic {ccRCC} patients.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2407-11-108},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Exosomes consist of membrane vesicles that are secreted by several cell types, including tumors and have been found in biological fluids. Exosomes interact with other cells and may serve as vehicles for the transfer of protein and {RNA} among cells.
{METHODS}: {SKOV}3 exosomes were labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl-ester and collected by ultracentrifugation. Uptake of these vesicles, under different conditions, by the same cells from where they originated was monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Lectin analysis was performed to investigate the glycosylation properties of proteins from exosomes and cellular extracts.
{RESULTS}: In this work, the ovarian carcinoma {SKOV}3 cell line has been shown to internalize exosomes from the same cells via several endocytic pathways that were strongly inhibited at 4°C, indicating their energy dependence. Partial colocalization with the endosome marker {EEA}1 and inhibition by chlorpromazine suggested the involvement of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, uptake inhibition in the presence of 5-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride, cytochalasin D and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin suggested the involvement of additional endocytic pathways. The uptake required proteins from the exosomes and from the cells since it was inhibited after proteinase K treatments. The exosomes were found to be enriched in specific mannose- and sialic acid-containing glycoproteins. Sialic acid removal caused a small but non-significant increase in uptake. Furthermore, the monosaccharides D-galactose, α-L-fucose, α-D-mannose, D-N-acetylglucosamine and the disaccharide β-lactose reduced exosomes uptake to a comparable extent as the control D-glucose.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In conclusion, exosomes are internalized by ovarian tumor cells via various endocytic pathways and proteins from exosomes and cells are required for uptake. On the other hand, exosomes are enriched in specific glycoproteins that may constitute exosome markers. This work contributes to the knowledge about the properties and dynamics of exosomes in cancer.},

Here, we demonstrate by tissue microarray and automated image analysis that the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript ({CART}) is expressed in primary and metastatic breast cancer and is an independent poor prognostic factor in estrogen receptor ({ER})-positive, lymph node-negative tumors in two separate breast cancer cohorts (n=690; P=0.002, 0.013). We also show that {CART} increases the transcriptional activity of {ERα} in a ligand-independent manner via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and that {CART} stimulates an autocrine/paracrine loop within tumor cells to amplify the {CART} signal. Additionally, we demonstrate that {CART} expression in {ER}-positive breast cancer cell lines protects against tamoxifen-mediated cell death and that high {CART} expression predicts disease outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients in vivo in three independent breast cancer cohorts. We believe that {CART} profiling will help facilitate stratification of lymph node-negative breast cancer patients into high- and low-risk categories and allow for the personalization of therapy.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}

This paper presents a global test to be used for the analysis of microarray data. Using this test it can be determined whether the global expression pattern of a group of genes is significantly related to some clinical outcome of interest. Groups of genes may be any size from a single gene to all genes on the chip (e.g. known pathways, specific areas of the genome or clusters from a cluster analysis).


{RESULT}

The test allows groups of genes of different size to be compared, because the test gives one p-value for the group, not a p-value for each gene. Researchers can use the test to investigate hypotheses based on theory or past research or to mine gene ontology databases for interesting pathways. Multiple testing problems do not occur unless many groups are tested. Special attention is given to visualizations of the test result, focussing on the associations between samples and showing the impact of individual genes on the test result.

	abstract = {Telomeres, repetitive {DNA} sequences found at the ends of linear chromosomes, play a role in regulating cellular proliferation, and shorten with increasing age in proliferating human tissues. The rate of age-related shortening of telomeres is highest early in life and decreases with age. Shortened telomeres are thought to limit the proliferation of cells and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although natural selection is widely assumed to operate against long telomeres because they entail increased cancer risk, the evidence for this is mixed. Instead, here it is proposed that telomere length is primarily limited by energetic constraints. Cell proliferation is energetically expensive, so shorter telomeres should lead to a thrifty phenotype. Shorter telomeres are proposed to restrain adaptive immunity as an energy saving mechanism. Such a limited immune system, however, might also result in chronic infections, inflammatory stress, premature aging, and death--a more "disposable soma." With an increased reproductive lifespan, the fitness costs of premature aging are higher and longer telomeres will be favored by selection. Telomeres exhibit a paternal effect whereby the offspring of older fathers have longer telomeres due to increased telomere lengths of sperm with age. This paternal effect is proposed to be an adaptive signal of the expected age of male reproduction in the environment offspring are born into. The offspring of lineages of older fathers will tend to have longer, and thereby less thrifty, telomeres, better preparing them for an environment with higher expected ages at reproduction.},

Typical examples are infectious diseases or immunology-related studies using blood samples, where, for example, the proportions of lymphocyte sub-populations are expected to vary between cases and controls. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization ({NMF}) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, notably in bioinformatics where its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays has been demonstrated. Very recently, it has been applied to biomarker discovery and gene expression deconvolution in heterogeneous tissue samples. Being essentially unsupervised, standard {NMF} methods are not guaranteed to find components corresponding to the cell types of interest in the sample, which may jeopardize the correct estimation of cell proportions. We have investigated the use of prior knowledge, in the form of a set of marker genes, to improve gene expression deconvolution with {NMF} algorithms. We found that this improves the consistency with which both cell type proportions and cell type gene expression signatures are estimated. The proposed method was tested on a microarray dataset consisting of pure cell types mixed in known proportions. Pearson correlation coefficients between true and estimated cell type proportions improved substantially (typically from about 0.5 to approximately 0.8) with the semi-supervised (marker-guided) versions of commonly used {NMF} algorithms. Furthermore known marker genes associated with each cell type were assigned to the correct cell type more frequently for the guided versions. We conclude that the use of marker genes improves the accuracy of gene expression deconvolution using {NMF} and suggest modifications to how the marker gene information is used that may lead to further improvements.},

To further understand the mechanisms underlying {PALB}2-mediated {DNA} repair and tumor suppression functions, we targeted Palb2 in the mouse. Palb2-deficient murine {ES} cells recapitulated {DNA} damage defects caused by {PALB}2 depletion in human cells, and germ-line deletion of Palb2 led to early embryonic lethality. Somatic deletion of Palb2 driven by K14-Cre led to mammary tumor formation with long latency. Codeletion of both Palb2 and Tumor protein 53 (Trp53) accelerated mammary tumor formation. Like {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 mutant breast cancers, these tumors were defective in {RAD}51 focus formation, reflecting a defect in Palb2 {HR}-{DSBR} function, a strongly suspected contributor to Brca1, Brca2, and Palb2 mammary tumor development. However, unlike the case of Brca1-mutant cells, Trp53bp1 deletion failed to rescue the genomic instability of Palb2- or Brca2-mutant primary lymphocytes. Therefore, Palb2-driven {DNA} damage control is, in part, distinct from that executed by Brca1 and more similar to that of Brca2. The mechanisms underlying Palb2 mammary tumor suppression functions can now be explored genetically in vivo.},

	abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. This is attributed to frequent presentation at late stage, when the tumor has metastasized, as well as to development of chemotherapy resistance along tumor progression. Patients with advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma have widespread intraperitoneal metastases, including the formation of malignant serous effusions within the peritoneal cavity. Pleural effusions constitute the most frequent site of distant metastasis ({FIGO} stage {IV} disease). Unlike the majority of solid tumors, particularly at the primary site, cancer cells in effusions are not amenable to surgical removal, and failure in their eradication is one of the main causes of treatment failure. Our research in recent years has demonstrated that a large number of cancer-associated molecules are differentially expressed in effusions compared to primary carcinomas and solid metastases. We have additionally observed that expression of several of these molecules differs between primary diagnosis (pre-chemotherapy) and disease recurrence (post-chemotherapy) specimens, and that they are significantly associated with response to chemotherapy and patient survival. These observations are thought to be related to disease progression, as well as to the unique microenvironment of effusions, and may have impact on the selection of targeted therapy in this cancer. This review discusses our recent observations with respect to the biology of ovarian carcinoma cells in effusions, and focuses on the clinical role of tumor-associated molecules at this anatomic site.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Clustering is a useful exploratory technique for the analysis of gene expression data. Many different heuristic clustering algorithms have been proposed in this context. Clustering algorithms based on probability models offer a principled alternative to heuristic algorithms. In particular, model-based clustering assumes that the data is generated by a finite mixture of underlying probability distributions such as multivariate normal distributions. The issues of selecting a 'good' clustering method and determining the 'correct' number of clusters are reduced to model selection problems in the probability framework. Gaussian mixture models have been shown to be a powerful tool for clustering in many applications.
{RESULTS}: We benchmarked the performance of model-based clustering on several synthetic and real gene expression data sets for which external evaluation criteria were available. The model-based approach has superior performance on our synthetic data sets, consistently selecting the correct model and the number of clusters. On real expression data, the model-based approach produced clusters of quality comparable to a leading heuristic clustering algorithm, but with the key advantage of suggesting the number of clusters and an appropriate model. We also explored the validity of the Gaussian mixture assumption on different transformations of real data. We also assessed the degree to which these real gene expression data sets fit multivariate Gaussian distributions both before and after subjecting them to commonly used data transformations. Suitably chosen transformations seem to result in reasonable fits.

These fibroblasts have an ability to substantially promote tumorigenesis. However, the precise cellular origins of {CAFs} and the molecular mechanisms by which these cells evolve into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts remain unclear. Using a coimplantation breast tumor xenograft model, we show that resident human mammary fibroblasts progressively convert into {CAF} myofibroblasts during the course of tumor progression. These cells increasingly acquire two autocrine signaling loops, mediated by {TGF}-β and {SDF}-1 cytokines, which both act in autostimulatory and cross-communicating fashions. These autocrine-signaling loops initiate and maintain the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and the concurrent tumor-promoting phenotype. Collectively, these findings indicate that the establishment of the self-sustaining {TGF}-β and {SDF}-1 autocrine signaling gives rise to tumor-promoting {CAF} myofibroblasts during tumor progression. This autocrine-signaling mechanism may prove to be an attractive therapeutic target to block the evolution of tumor-promoting {CAFs}.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed ({DE}) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of {DE} genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe.
{RESULTS}: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis ({SPIA}) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that {SPIA} has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods.

Exosomes are important mediators of intercellular communication in immune signaling, tumor survival, stress responses, and angiogenesis. The ability of exosomes to incorporate and transfer messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) encoding for "acquired" proteins or micro {RNAs} ({miRNAs}) repressing "resident" {mRNA} translation suggests that they can influence the physiological behavior of recipient cells. We demonstrate that {miR}-214, an {miRNA} that controls endothelial cell function and angiogenesis, plays a dominant role in exosome-mediated signaling between endothelial cells. Endothelial cell-derived exosomes stimulated migration and angiogenesis in recipient cells, whereas exosomes from {miR}-214-depleted endothelial cells failed to stimulate these processes. Exosomes containing {miR}-214 repressed the expression of ataxia telangiectasia mutated in recipient cells, thereby preventing senescence and allowing blood vessel formation. Concordantly, specific reduction of {miR}-214 content in exosome-producing endothelial cells abolishes the angiogenesis stimulatory function of the resulting exosomes.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by tumour cells which have roles in paracrine signalling during tumour progression, including tumour-stromal interactions, activation of proliferative pathways and bestowing immunosuppression. Hypoxia is an important feature of solid tumours which promotes tumour progression, angiogenesis and metastasis, potentially through exosome-mediated signalling.
{METHODS}: Breast cancer cell lines were cultured under either moderate (1\% O2) or severe (0.1\% O2) hypoxia. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis ({NTA}) and immunoblotting for the exosomal protein {CD}63 in order to assess the impact of hypoxia on exosome release. Hypoxic exosome fractions were assayed for {miR}-210 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and normalised to exogenous and endogenous control genes. Statistical significance was determined using the Student T test with a P value of {\textless} 0.05 considered significant.
{RESULTS}: Exposure of three different breast cancer cell lines to moderate (1\% O2) and severe (0.1\% O2) hypoxia resulted in significant increases in the number of exosomes present in the conditioned media as determined by {NTA} and {CD}63 immunoblotting. Activation of hypoxic signalling by dimethyloxalylglycine, a hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF}) hydroxylase inhibitor, resulted in significant increase in exosome release. Transfection of cells with {HIF}-1α {siRNA} prior to hypoxic exposure prevented the enhancement of exosome release by hypoxia. The hypoxically regulated {miR}-210 was identified to be present at elevated levels in hypoxic exosome fractions.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data provide evidence that hypoxia promotes the release of exosomes by breast cancer cells, and that this hypoxic response may be mediated by {HIF}-1α. Given an emerging role for tumour cell-derived exosomes in tumour progression, this has significant implications for understanding the hypoxic tumour phenotype, whereby hypoxic cancer cells may release more exosomes into their microenvironment to promote their own survival and invasion.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular environment by various types of cells, including tumor cells. Exosomes are enriched with a discrete set of cellular proteins, and therefore expected to exert diverse biological functions according to cell origin. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) possess the potential for differentiation into multilineages and can also function as precursors for tumor stroma including myofibroblast that provides a favorable environment for tumor progression. Although a close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a neoplastic tumor microenvironment has already been revealed, how this communication works is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of tumor cell-derived exosomes on {MSCs} by treating adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}) with breast cancer-derived exosomes. The exosome-treated {ADSCs} exhibited the phenotypes of tumor-associated myofibroblasts with increased expression of α-{SMA}. Exosome treatment also induced increased expression of tumor-promoting factors {SDF}-1, {VEGF}, {CCL}5 and {TGFβ}. This phenomenon was correlated with increased expression of {TGFβ} receptor I and {II}. Analysis of {SMAD}2, a key player in the {TGFβ} receptor-mediated {SMAD} pathway, revealed that its phosphorylation was increased by exosome treatment and was inhibited by treatment with {SB}431542, an inhibitor of the {SMAD}-mediated pathway, resulting in decreased expression of α-{SMA}. Taken together, our results show that tumor-derived exosomes induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} via the {SMAD}-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that tumor-derived exosomes can contribute to progression and malignancy of tumor cells by converting {MSCs} within tumor stroma into tumor-associated myofibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.},

Breast cancer cells transferred their own exosomes to other cancer cells and normal lung tissue cells in culture. In orthotopic nude-mouse models, breast cancer cells secreted exosomes into the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-derived exosomes were incorporated into tumor-associated cells as well as circulating in the blood of mice with breast cancer metastases.

Computational deconvolution of global gene expression is an appealing alternative to costly physical sample separation techniques and enables a more detailed analysis of the underlying biological processes at the cell-type level. To facilitate and popularize the application of such methods, we developed {CellMix}, an R package that incorporates most state-of-the-art deconvolution methods, into an intuitive and extendible framework, providing a single entry point to explore, assess and disentangle gene expression data from heterogeneous samples.

The aim of our study was to determine the incidence, clinical relevance, and prognostic and predictive impact of somatic mutations in both types I and {II} {EOCs}.
{METHODS}: Two hundred sixty-two evaluable, primary, high-risk stage I (grade 3, or aneuploid grade 1 or 2, or clear cell) and stage {II}-{IV} {EOCs}, collected at the University Hospitals Leuven and within the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 55971 trial, were genotyped for hotspot mutations in {KRAS} ({COSMIC} [Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer] coverage {\textgreater}97\%), {BRAF} ({\textgreater}94\%), {NRAS} ({\textgreater}97\%), {PIK}3CA ({\textgreater}79\%), {PTEN}, {FBXW}7 ({\textgreater}57\%), {AKT}2, {AKT}3, and {FOXL}2, using Sequenom {MassARRAY}.
{RESULTS}: Of the 13\% histopathologically classified type I tumors, 49\% were {KRAS} or {PIK}3CA mutant versus only 2.9\% in the type {II} tumors (87\%). Mucinous subtypes harbored significantly more {KRAS} mutations than all nonmucinous tumors (50\% vs 4\%, P {\textless} 0.001). {PIK}3CA mutations were predominantly found in clear cell carcinomas (46.2\%) and endometrioid carcinoma (20\%) and were frequently associated with endometriosis. Moreover, low-grade serous tumors were more frequently {KRAS} or {BRAF} mutated (44\%) than high-grade serous tumors (0.6\%). {KRAS} or {PIK}3CA mutation did not correlate with progression-free survival or overall survival. Mutations in {NRAS}, {PTEN}, {FBXW}7, {AKT}2, {AKT}3, and {FOXL}2 were rare ({\textless}1\%).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Somatic mutations are rare in type {II} {EOCs}, whereas type I {EOCs} contain distinct diseases with different driver mutations. In general, these tumors respond worse to standard paclitaxel carboplatin therapy. Clinical trials with molecular targeted therapy in the different subtypes of type I tumors are urgently needed using this theragnostic information.},

Exosomes are secreted microvesicles that are emerging as potent mediators of cell–cell communication that are of particular importance in tumor–stroma interactions. The Wnt-planar cell polarity ({PCP}) pathway is the primary regulator of convergent extension cell movements during vertebrate development, but the role of this signaling pathway in cancer cell migration and metastasis has been unclear. Recently, we revealed that fibroblasts secrete exosomes that promote breast cancer cell ({BCC}) protrusive activity, motility, and metastasis by activating autocrine Wnt-{PCP} signaling in {BCCs}. Moreover, we showed that Wnt ligands produced by {BCCs} tether to fibroblast exosomes upon trafficking of exosomes in {BCCs}. These findings have several implications that motivate promising future research in the fields of tumor–stroma communication, exosome function, and Wnt-{PCP} signaling in cancer metastasis.

Estrogen exerts its effects on healing via numerous cell types by signalling through the receptors {ERα} and {ERβ}, which bind to the Estrogen Responsive Element ({ERE}) and initiate gene transcription. The {ERE}-luciferase transgenic mouse model has been influential in assessing real-time in vivo estrogen receptor activation across a range of tissues and pathologies. Using this model we demonstrate novel temporally regulated peri-wound activation of estrogen signalling in female mice. Using histological methods we reveal that this signal is specifically localised to keratinocytes of the neoepidermis and wound margin dermal cells. Moreover using pharmacological agonists we reveal that {ERβ} induces {ERE}-mediated signal in both epidermal and dermal cells while {ERα} induces {ERE}-mediated signal in dermal cells alone. Collectively these novel data demonstrate rapid and regional activation of estrogen signalling in wounded skin. A more complete understanding of local hormonal signalling during repair is essential for the focussed development of new therapies for wound healing.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene set enrichment ({GSE}) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible {GSE} methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.
{RESULTS}: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis ({GSVA}), a {GSE} method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of {GSVA} in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how {GSVA} works analogously with data from both microarray and {RNA}-seq experiments.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {GSVA} provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While {GSE} methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, {GSVA} constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, {GSVA} contributes to the current need of {GSE} methods for {RNA}-seq data. {GSVA} is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

	abstract = {This report provides a global view of how gene expression is affected by {DNA} replication. We analyzed synchronized cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions that prevent {DNA} replication initiation without delaying cell cycle progression. We use a higher-order singular value decomposition to integrate the global {mRNA} expression measured in the multiple time courses, detect and remove experimental artifacts and identify significant combinations of patterns of expression variation across the genes, time points and conditions. We find that, first, approximately 88\% of the global {mRNA} expression is independent of {DNA} replication. Second, the requirement of {DNA} replication for efficient histone gene expression is independent of conditions that elicit {DNA} damage checkpoint responses. Third, origin licensing decreases the expression of genes with origins near their 3' ends, revealing that downstream origins can regulate the expression of upstream genes. This confirms previous predictions from mathematical modeling of a global causal coordination between {DNA} replication origin activity and {mRNA} expression, and shows that mathematical modeling of {DNA} microarray data can be used to correctly predict previously unknown biological modes of regulation.},

This chapter introduces basic linear and multilinear models for matrix and tensor factorizations and decompositions. The “workhorse” of this chapter consists of constrained matrix decompositions and their extensions, including multilinear models which perform multiway matrix or tensor factorizations, with various constraints such as orthogonality, statistical independence, nonnegativity and/or sparsity. The constrained matrix and tensor decompositions are very attractive because they take into account spatial, temporal and/or spectral information and provide links among the various extracted factors or latent variables while providing often physical or physiological meanings and interpretations. In fact matrix/tensor decompositions are important techniques for blind source separation, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, object detection, classification, multiway clustering, sparse representation and coding and data fusion.},

	abstract = {Conventional anticancer drug screening is typically performed in the absence of accessory cells of the tumor microenvironment, which can profoundly alter antitumor drug activity. To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging ({CS}-{BLI}) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. {CS}-{BLI} is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, {NF}-{kappaB}, {HIF}-1alpha, myc, {hTERT} and {IRF}4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, {CS}-{BLI} can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of {CS}-{BLI}, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.},

	abstract = {Telomere length ({TL}) dynamics in vivo are defined by {TL} and its age-dependent change, brought about by cell replication. Leukocyte {TL} ({LTL}), which reflects {TL} in hematopoietic stem cells ({HSCs}), becomes shorter with age. In contrast, sperm {TL}, which reflects {TL} in the male germ cells, becomes longer with age. Moreover, offspring of older fathers display longer {LTL}. Thus far, no study has examined {LTL} and sperm {TL} relations with age in the same individuals, nor considered their implications for the paternal age at conception ({PAC}) effect on offspring {LTL}. We report that in 135 men (mean age: 34.4 years; range: 18-68 years) on average, {LTL} became shorter by 19 bp/year (r = -0.3; P = 0.0004), while sperm {TL} became longer by 57 bp/year (r = 0.32; P = 0.0002). Based on previously reported replication rates of {HSCs} and male germ cells, we estimate that {HSCs} lose 26 bp per replication. However, male germ cells gain only 2.48 bp per replication. As {TL} is inherited in an allele-specific manner, the magnitude of the {PAC} effect on the offspring's {LTL} should be approximately half of age-dependent sperm-{TL} elongation. When we compared the {PAC} effect data from previous studies with sperm-{TL} data from this study, the result was consistent with this prediction. As older paternal age is largely a feature of contemporary humans, we suggest that there may be progressive elongation of {TL} in future generations. In this sense, germ cell {TL} dynamics could be driving the evolution of {TL} in modern humans and perhaps telomere-related diseases in the general population.},

	title = {Directing experimental biology: a case study in mitochondrial biogenesis.},
	volume = {5},
	abstract = {Computational approaches have promised to organize collections of functional genomics data into testable predictions of gene and protein involvement in biological processes and pathways. However, few such predictions have been experimentally validated on a large scale, leaving many bioinformatic methods unproven and underutilized in the biology community. Further, it remains unclear what biological concerns should be taken into account when using computational methods to drive real-world experimental efforts. To investigate these concerns and to establish the utility of computational predictions of gene function, we experimentally tested hundreds of predictions generated from an ensemble of three complementary methods for the process of mitochondrial organization and biogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The biological data with respect to the mitochondria are presented in a companion manuscript published in {PLoS} Genetics (doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000407). Here we analyze and explore the results of this study that are broadly applicable for computationalists applying gene function prediction techniques, including a new experimental comparison with 48 genes representing the genomic background. Our study leads to several conclusions that are important to consider when driving laboratory investigations using computational prediction approaches. While most genes in yeast are already known to participate in at least one biological process, we confirm that genes with known functions can still be strong candidates for annotation of additional gene functions. We find that different analysis techniques and different underlying data can both greatly affect the types of functional predictions produced by computational methods. This diversity allows an ensemble of techniques to substantially broaden the biological scope and breadth of predictions. We also find that performing prediction and validation steps iteratively allows us to more completely characterize a biological area of interest. While this study focused on a specific functional area in yeast, many of these observations may be useful in the contexts of other processes and organisms.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2407-12-421},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Exosomes are nanovesicles secreted by tumour cells which have roles in paracrine signalling during tumour progression, including tumour-stromal interactions, activation of proliferative pathways and bestowing immunosuppression. Hypoxia is an important feature of solid tumours which promotes tumour progression, angiogenesis and metastasis, potentially through exosome-mediated signalling.
{METHODS}: Breast cancer cell lines were cultured under either moderate (1\% O2) or severe (0.1\% O2) hypoxia. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned media and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis ({NTA}) and immunoblotting for the exosomal protein {CD}63 in order to assess the impact of hypoxia on exosome release. Hypoxic exosome fractions were assayed for {miR}-210 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and normalised to exogenous and endogenous control genes. Statistical significance was determined using the Student T test with a P value of {\textless} 0.05 considered significant.
{RESULTS}: Exposure of three different breast cancer cell lines to moderate (1\% O2) and severe (0.1\% O2) hypoxia resulted in significant increases in the number of exosomes present in the conditioned media as determined by {NTA} and {CD}63 immunoblotting. Activation of hypoxic signalling by dimethyloxalylglycine, a hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF}) hydroxylase inhibitor, resulted in significant increase in exosome release. Transfection of cells with {HIF}-1α {siRNA} prior to hypoxic exposure prevented the enhancement of exosome release by hypoxia. The hypoxically regulated {miR}-210 was identified to be present at elevated levels in hypoxic exosome fractions.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data provide evidence that hypoxia promotes the release of exosomes by breast cancer cells, and that this hypoxic response may be mediated by {HIF}-1α. Given an emerging role for tumour cell-derived exosomes in tumour progression, this has significant implications for understanding the hypoxic tumour phenotype, whereby hypoxic cancer cells may release more exosomes into their microenvironment to promote their own survival and invasion.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Global gene expression analysis of tumor samples has been a valuable tool to subgroup tumors and has the potential to be of prognostic and predictive value. However, tumors are heterogeneous, and homogenates will consist of several different cell types. This study was designed to obtain more refined expression data representing different compartments of the tumor.

Methods
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded stroma-rich triple-negative breast cancer tumors were laser-microdissected, and {RNA} was extracted and processed to enable microarray hybridization. Genes enriched in stroma were identified and used to generate signatures by identifying correlating genes in publicly available data sets. The prognostic implications of the signature were analyzed.

Results
Comparison of the expression pattern from stromal and cancer cell compartments from three tumors revealed a number of genes that were essentially specifically expressed in the respective compartments. The stroma-specific genes indicated contribution from fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune/inflammatory cells. The gene set was expanded by identifying correlating {mRNAs} using breast cancer {mRNA} expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By iterative analyses, 16 gene signatures of highly correlating genes were characterized. Based on the gene composition, they seem to represent different cell types. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, two immune/inflammatory signatures had opposing hazard ratios for breast cancer recurrence also after adjusting for clinicopathological variables and molecular subgroup. The signature associated with poor prognosis consisted mainly of C1Q genes and the one associated with good prognosis contained {HLA} genes. This association with prognosis was seen for other cancers as well as in other breast cancer data sets.

Conclusions
Our data indicate that the molecular composition of the immune response in a tumor may be a powerful predictor of cancer prognosis.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Endometriosis is an enigmatic disease. Gene expression profiling of endometriosis has been used in several studies, but few studies went further to classify subtypes of endometriosis based on expression patterns and to identify possible pathways involved in endometriosis. Some of the observed pathways are more inconsistent between the studies, and these candidate pathways presumably only represent a fraction of the pathways involved in endometriosis.


{METHODS}

We applied a standardised microarray preprocessing and gene set enrichment analysis to six independent studies, and demonstrated increased concordance between these gene datasets.


{RESULTS}

We find 16 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated pathways common in ovarian endometriosis data sets, 22 up-regulated and one down-regulated pathway common in peritoneal endometriosis data sets. Among them, 12 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated were found consistent between ovarian and peritoneal endometriosis. The main canonical pathways identified are related to immunological and inflammatory disease. Early secretory phase has the most over-represented pathways in the three uterine cycle phases. There are no overlapping significant pathways between the dataset from human endometrial endothelial cells and the datasets from ovarian endometriosis which used whole tissues.


{CONCLUSION}

The study of complex diseases through pathway analysis is able to highlight genes weakly connected to the phenotype which may be difficult to detect by using classical univariate statistics. By standardised microarray preprocessing and {GSEA}, we have increased the concordance in identifying many biological mechanisms involved in endometriosis. The identified gene pathways will shed light on the understanding of endometriosis and promote the development of novel therapies.},

In multivariate analysis a common way to inspect the relationship between two sets of variables based on their correlation is canonical correlation analysis, which determines linear combinations of all variables of each type with maximal correlation between the two linear combinations. However, in high dimensional data analysis, when the number of variables under consideration exceeds tens of thousands, linear combinations of the entire sets of features may lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In addition, insufficient sample size may lead to computational problems, inaccurate estimates of parameters and non-generalizable results. These problems may be solved by selecting sparse subsets of variables, i.e. obtaining sparse loadings in the linear combinations of variables of each type. In this paper we present Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis ({SCCA}) which examines the relationships between two types of variables and provides sparse solutions that include only small subsets of variables of each type by maximizing the correlation between the subsets of variables of different types while performing variable selection. We also present an extension of {SCCA}--adaptive {SCCA}. We evaluate their properties using simulated data and illustrate practical use by applying both methods to the study of natural variation in human gene expression.},

By studying a large number of cases, we aimed to compare the clinicopathological features of {ILC} with those of nonlobular infiltrating carcinoma ({NLIC}) and to assess the advisability of conservative therapy in the management of {ILC}. {METHODS}. The population analyzed included 726 cases of {ILC}, 249 cases of mixed {ILC}/invasive ductal carcinoma ({ILC}/{IDC}), and 10,061 cases of {NLIC}. The age of patients, {TNM} status, estrogen- and progesterone-receptor status ({ER}, {PR}), and histologic grades of the 3 groups were compared. The follow-up was carried out on a subgroup of 5846 cases. {RESULTS}. At diagnosis, {ILC} tumors were found to be larger on average and were detected in patients older than those with {NLIC}, but the degree of lymph node involvement was lower in patients with {ILC} than in {NLIC}. In {ILC}, tumors are more frequently grade I and {ER}-positive than in {NLIC}. Multicentric lesions were not significantly more frequent in {ILC} than in {NLIC}. The overall survival, locoregional control, disease free interval, and metastatic spread rates were not different among the three groups neither by univariate nor multivariate analysis, but the pattern of metastatic dissemination was different. In 480 cases of {ILC} considered for conservation therapy, the local recurrence and overall survival rates were similar to those observed for {IDC}. {CONCLUSIONS}.

{ABSTRACT}:


{BACKGROUND}

Numerous transgenic models have been generated to study breast cancer. However, despite many advantages, traditional transgenic models for breast cancer are also burdened with difficulties in early detection and longitudinal observation of transgene-induced tumours, which in most cases are randomly located and occur at various time points. Methods such as palpation followed by mechanical measurement of the tumours are of limited value in transgenic models. There is a crucial need for making these previously generated models suitable for modern methods of tumour visualisation and monitoring, e.g. by bioluminescence-based techniques. This approach was successfully used in the current study.


{RESULTS}

A new mouse strain ({MMTV}-Luc2 mice) expressing Luc2 luciferase primarily in mammary tissue in females, with low-level background expression in internal organs, was generated and bred to homozygosity. After these mice were intercrossed with {MMTV}-{PyVT} mice, all double transgenic females developed mammary tumours by the age of 10 weeks, the localisation and progression of which could be effectively monitored using the luminescence-based in vivo imaging. Luminescence-based readout allowed for early visualisation of the locally overgrown mammary tissue and for longitudinal evaluation of local progression of the tumours. When sampled ex vivo at the age of 10 weeks, all tumours derived from {MMTV}-Luc2PyVT females displayed robust bioluminescent signal.


{CONCLUSIONS}

We have created a novel transgenic strain for visualisation and longitudinal monitoring of mammary tumour development in transgenic mice as an addition and/or a new and more advanced alternative to manual methods. Generation of this mouse strain is vital for making many of the existing mammary tumour transgenic models applicable for in vivo imaging techniques.},

In this review, we dissect the most recent data on this genomic classification of breast cancer with a special focus on the Claudin-low subtype, which appears enriched for mesenchymal and stem cell features. In addition, we discuss how the combination of standard clinical-pathological markers with the information provided by these genomic entities might help further understand the biological complexity of this disease, increase the efficacy of current and novel therapies, and ultimately improve outcomes for breast cancer patients.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2407-13-4},
	shorttitle = {Human endogenous retroviruses and cancer prevention},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cancer is a significant and growing problem worldwide. While this increase may, in part, be attributed to increasing longevity, improved case notifications and risk-enhancing lifestyle (such as smoking, diet and obesity), hygiene-related factors resulting in immuno-regulatory failure may also play a major role and call for a revision of vaccination strategies to protect against a range of cancers in addition to infections.
{DISCUSSION}: Human endogenous retroviruses ({HERVs}) are a significant component of a wider family of retroelements that constitutes part of the human genome. They were originated by the integration of exogenous retroviruses into the human genome millions of years ago. {HERVs} are estimated to comprise about 8\% of human {DNA} and are ubiquitous in somatic and germinal tissues.Physiologic and pathologic processes are influenced by some biologically active {HERV} families. {HERV} antigens are only expressed at low levels by the host, but in circumstances of inappropriate control their genes may initiate or maintain pathological processes. Although the precise mechanism leading to abnormal {HERVs} gene expression has yet to be clearly elucidated, environmental factors seem to be involved by influencing the human immune system.{HERV}-K expression has been detected in different types of tumors.Among the various human endogenous retroviral families, the K series was the latest acquired by the human species. Probably because of its relatively recent origin, the {HERV}-K is the most complete and biologically active family.The abnormal expression of {HERV}-K seemingly triggers pathological processes leading to melanoma onset, but also contributes to the morphological and functional cellular modifications implicated in melanoma maintenance and progression.The {HERV}-K-{MEL} antigen is encoded by a pseudo-gene incorporated in the {HERV}-K env-gene. {HERV}-K-{MEL} is significantly expressed in the majority of dysplastic and normal naevi, as well as other tumors like sarcoma, lymphoma, bladder and breast cancer. An amino acid sequence similar to {HERV}-K-{MEL}, recognized to cause a significant protective effect against melanoma, is shared by the antigenic determinants expressed by some vaccines such as {BCG}, vaccinia virus and the yellow fever virus.{HERV}-K are also reactivated in the majority of human breast cancers. Monoclonal and single-chain antibodies against the {HERV}-K Env protein recently proved capable of blocking the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro, inhibiting tumor growth in mice bearing xenograft tumors.
{SUMMARY}: A recent epidemiological study provided provisional evidence of how melanoma risk could possibly be reduced if the yellow fever virus vaccine ({YFV}) were received at least 10 years before, possibly preventing tumor initiation rather than culling melanoma cells already compromised. Further research is recommended to confirm the temporal pattern of this protection and eliminate/attenuate the potential role of relevant confounders as socio-economic status and other vaccinations.It appears also appropriate to examine the potential protective effect of {YFV} against other malignancies expressing high levels of {HERV}-K antigens, namely breast cancer, sarcoma, lymphoma and bladder cancer.Tumor immune-therapy, as described for the monoclonal antibodies against breast cancer, is indeed considered more complex and less advantageous than immune-prevention. Cellular immunity possibly triggered by vaccines as for {YFV} might also be involved in anti-cancer response, in addition to humoral immunity.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {We studied the relationship between growth rate and genome-wide gene expression, cell cycle progression, and glucose metabolism in 36 steady-state continuous cultures limited by one of six different nutrients (glucose, ammonium, sulfate, phosphate, uracil, or leucine). The expression of more than one quarter of all yeast genes is linearly correlated with growth rate, independent of the limiting nutrient. The subset of negatively growth-correlated genes is most enriched for peroxisomal functions, whereas positively correlated genes mainly encode ribosomal functions. Many (not all) genes associated with stress response are strongly correlated with growth rate, as are genes that are periodically expressed under conditions of metabolic cycling. We confirmed a linear relationship between growth rate and the fraction of the cell population in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase, independent of limiting nutrient. Cultures limited by auxotrophic requirements wasted excess glucose, whereas those limited on phosphate, sulfate, or ammonia did not; this phenomenon (reminiscent of the "Warburg effect" in cancer cells) was confirmed in batch cultures. Using an aggregate of gene expression values, we predict (in both continuous and batch cultures) an "instantaneous growth rate." This concept is useful in interpreting the system-level connections among growth rate, metabolism, stress, and the cell cycle.},

In this study, we used public databases to identify an {mRNA}-like, candidate long non-coding {RNA}, {GHSROS} ({GHSR} opposite strand), transcribed from the antisense strand of the ghrelin receptor gene, growth hormone secretagogue receptor ({GHSR}). Quantitative real-time {RT}-{PCR} revealed higher expression of {GHSROS} in lung cancer tissue compared to adjacent, non-tumour lung tissue. In common with many long non-coding {RNAs}, {GHSROS} is 5' capped and 3' polyadenylated ({mRNA}-like), lacks an extensive open reading frame and harbours a transposable element. Engineered overexpression of {GHSROS} stimulated cell migration in the A549 and {NCI}-H1299 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, but suppressed cell migration in the Beas-2B normal lung-derived bronchoepithelial cell line. This suggests that {GHSROS} function may be dependent on the oncogenic context. The identification of {GHSROS}, which is expressed in lung cancer and stimulates cell migration in lung cancer cell lines, contributes to the growing number of non-coding {RNAs} that play a role in the regulation of tumourigenesis and metastatic cancer progression.},

	abstract = {Breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and Her2 amplification exhibit distinct gene expression profiles and clinical features, and they comprise the majority of {BRCA}1-associated tumors. Here we demonstrated that the p53 family member p63 controls a pathway for p73-dependent cisplatin sensitivity specific to these "triple-negative" tumors. In vivo, {DeltaNp}63 and {TAp}73 isoforms were coexpressed exclusively within a subset of triple-negative primary breast cancers that commonly exhibited mutational inactivation of p53. The {DeltaNp}63alpha isoform promoted survival of breast cancer cells by binding {TAp}73 and thereby inhibiting its proapoptotic activity. Consequently, inhibition of p63 by {RNA} interference led to {TAp}73-dependent induction of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and apoptosis. Breast cancer cells expressing {DeltaNp}63alpha and {TAp}73 exhibited cisplatin sensitivity that was uniquely dependent on {TAp}73. Thus, in response to treatment with cisplatin, but not other chemotherapeutic agents, {TAp}73 underwent c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation, which promoted dissociation of the {DeltaNp}63alpha/{TAp}73 protein complex, {TAp}73-dependent transcription of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and apoptosis. These findings define p63 as a survival factor in a subset of breast cancers; furthermore, they provide what we believe to be a novel mechanism for cisplatin sensitivity in these triple-negative cancers, and they suggest that such cancers may share the cisplatin sensitivity of {BRCA}1-associated tumors.},

We analyzed the functional coverage of this collection and we designed a context-sensitive search algorithm for rapid exploration of the compendium. A researcher using our system provides a small set of query genes to establish a biological search context; based on this query, we weight each dataset's relevance to the context, and within these weighted datasets we identify additional genes that are co-expressed with the query set. Our method exhibits an average increase in accuracy of 273\% compared to previous mega-clustering approaches when recapitulating known biology. Further, we find that our search paradigm identifies novel biological predictions that can be verified through further experimentation. Our methodology provides the ability for biological researchers to explore the totality of existing microarray data in a manner useful for drawing conclusions and formulating hypotheses, which we believe is invaluable for the research community.Availability: Our query-driven search engine, called {SPELL}, is available at http://function.princeton.edu/{SPELLContact}: ogt@genomics.princeton.{eduSupplementary} information: Several additional data files, figures and discussions are available at http://function.princeton.edu/{SPELL}/supplement},

To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant ({MCF}10A) and a breast cancer derived ({MDA}-{MB}231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues ({NAF}) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts ({CAF}), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In {MDA}-{MB}231 highly represented genes downregulated by {CAF} derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between {ER} and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of {MCF}10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While {NAF} downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in {MDA}-{MB}231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in {MCF}10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. {NAFs} responded to coculture with {MDA}-{MB}231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by {TGFbeta}1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in {NAFs} gene expression profile influenced by {MCF}10A. {CAFs} responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.},

Within this context, the management of lymph node-negative breast cancer is the subject of much debate with particular emphasis on the requirement for adjuvant chemotherapy. The identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers in this group of patients is crucial. Here, we demonstrate by tissue microarray and automated image analysis that the cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript ({CART}) is expressed in primary and metastatic breast cancer and is an independent poor prognostic factor in estrogen receptor ({ER})-positive, lymph node-negative tumors in two separate breast cancer cohorts (n=690; P=0.002, 0.013). We also show that {CART} increases the transcriptional activity of {ERα} in a ligand-independent manner via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and that {CART} stimulates an autocrine/paracrine loop within tumor cells to amplify the {CART} signal. Additionally, we demonstrate that {CART} expression in {ER}-positive breast cancer cell lines protects against tamoxifen-mediated cell death and that high {CART} expression predicts disease outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients in vivo in three independent breast cancer cohorts. We believe that {CART} profiling will help facilitate stratification of lymph node-negative breast cancer patients into high- and low-risk categories and allow for the personalization of therapy.Oncogene advance online publication, 5 December 2011; doi:10.1038/onc.2011.519.},

	abstract = {It has been proposed that epithelial cells can acquire invasive properties through exposure to paracrine signals originated from mesenchymal cells within the tumor microenvironment. Transforming growth factor-β ({TGF}-β) has been revealed as an active factor that mediates the epithelial-stroma cross-talk that facilitates cell invasion and metastasis. {TGF}-β signaling is modulated by the coreceptor Endoglin (Eng), which shows a tumor suppressor activity in epithelial cells and regulates the {ALK}1-Smad1,5,8 as well as the {ALK}5-Smad2,3 signaling pathways. In the current work, we present evidence showing that cell surface Eng abundance in epithelial {MCF}-7 breast cancer cells is inversely related with cell motility. Shedding of Eng in {MCF}-7 cell surface by soluble matrix metalloproteinase-14 ({MMP}-14) derived from the {HS}-5 bone-marrow-derived cell line induces a motile epithelial phenotype. On the other hand, restoration of full-length Eng expression blocks the stromal stimulus on migration. Processing of surface Eng by stromal factors was demonstrated by biotin-neutravidin labeling of cell surface proteins and this processing generated a shift in {TGF}-β signaling through the activation of Smad2,3 pathway. Stromal {MMP}-14 abundance was stimulated by {TGF}-β secreted by {MCF}-7 cells acting in a paracrine manner. In turn, the stromal proteolytic activity of soluble {MMP}-14, by inducing Eng shedding, promoted malignant progression. From these data, and due to the capacity of {TGF}-β to regulate malignancy in epithelial cancer, we propose that stromal-dependent epithelial Eng shedding constitutes a putative mechanism that exerts an environmental control of cell malignancy.},

These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing. {RESULTS}: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.},

We also detected {PI}3K-{PTEN}-{AKT}-upregulating genetic alterations among 22\% of progressive melanomas. Distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. Beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from {BRAF} inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. Thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to {BRAF} inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0018768},
	abstract = {Evolutionary relationships among organisms are commonly described by using a hierarchy derived from comparisons of ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}) sequences. We propose that even on the level of a single {rRNA} molecule, an organism's evolution is composed of multiple pathways due to concurrent forces that act independently upon different {rRNA} degrees of freedom. Relationships among organisms are then compositions of coexisting pathway-dependent similarities and dissimilarities, which cannot be described by a single hierarchy. We computationally test this hypothesis in comparative analyses of 16S and 23S {rRNA} sequence alignments by using a tensor decomposition, i.e., a framework for modeling composite data. Each alignment is encoded in a cuboid, i.e., a third-order tensor, where nucleotides, positions and organisms, each represent a degree of freedom. A tensor mode-1 higher-order singular value decomposition ({HOSVD}) is formulated such that it separates each cuboid into combinations of patterns of nucleotide frequency variation across organisms and positions, i.e., "eigenpositions" and corresponding nucleotide-specific segments of "eigenorganisms," respectively, independent of a-priori knowledge of the taxonomic groups or {rRNA} structures. We find, in support of our hypothesis that, first, the significant eigenpositions reveal multiple similarities and dissimilarities among the taxonomic groups. Second, the corresponding eigenorganisms identify insertions or deletions of nucleotides exclusively conserved within the corresponding groups, that map out entire substructures and are enriched in adenosines, unpaired in the {rRNA} secondary structure, that participate in tertiary structure interactions. This demonstrates that structural motifs involved in {rRNA} folding and function are evolutionary degrees of freedom. Third, two previously unknown coexisting subgenic relationships between Microsporidia and Archaea are revealed in both the 16S and 23S {rRNA} alignments, a convergence and a divergence, conferred by insertions and deletions of these motifs, which cannot be described by a single hierarchy. This shows that mode-1 {HOSVD} modeling of {rRNA} alignments might be used to computationally predict evolutionary mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The majority of breast cancer deaths result from metastases rather than from direct effects of the primary tumor itself. Recently, Landemaine and colleagues described a six-gene signature purported to predict lung metastasis risk. They analyzed gene expression in 23 metastases from breast cancer patients (5 lung, 18 non-lung) identifying a 21-gene signature. Expression of 16 of these was analyzed in primary breast tumors from 72 patients with known outcome, and six were selected that were predictive of lung metastases: {DSC}2, {TFCP}2L1, {UGT}8, {ITGB}8, {ANP}32E, and {FERMT}1. Despite the value of such a signature, our analysis indicates that this analysis ignored potentially important confounding factors and that their signature is instead a surrogate for molecular subtype.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Exosomes are 30-100 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin produced by numerous cells. They can mediate diverse biological functions, including antigen presentation. Exosomes have recently been shown to contain functional {RNA}, which can be delivered to other cells. Exosomes may thus mediate biological functions either by surface-to-surface interactions with cells, or by the delivery of functional {RNA} to cells. Our aim was therefore to determine the presence of {RNA} in exosomes from human saliva, plasma and breast milk and whether these exosomes can be taken up by macrophages.
{METHOD}: Exosomes were purified from human saliva, plasma and breast milk using ultracentrifugation and filtration steps. Exosomes were detected by electron microscopy and examined by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed by capturing the exosomes on anti-{MHC} class {II} coated beads, and further stain with anti-{CD}9, anti-{CD}63 or anti-{CD}81. Breast milk exosomes were further analysed for the presence of Hsc70, {CD}81 and calnexin by Western blot. Total {RNA} was detected with a Bioanalyzer and {mRNA} was identified by the synthesis of {cDNA} using an oligo ({dT}) primer and analysed with a Bioanalyzer. The uptake of {PKH}67-labelled saliva and breast milk exosomes by macrophages was examined by measuring fluorescence using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy.
{RESULTS}: {RNA} was detected in exosomes from all three body fluids. A portion of the detected {RNA} in plasma exosomes was characterised as {mRNA}. Our result extends the characterisation of exosomes in healthy humans and confirms the presence of {RNA} in human saliva and plasma exosomes and reports for the first time the presence of {RNA} in breast milk exosomes. Our results also show that the saliva and breast milk exosomes can be taken up by human macrophages.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Exosomes in saliva, plasma and breast milk all contain {RNA}, confirming previous findings that exosomes from several sources contain {RNA}. Furthermore, exosomes are readily taken up by macrophages, supporting the notion that exosomal {RNA} can be shuttled between cells.},

The characteristics of "molecular" breast cancer subtypes suggest that routinely assessed histopathologic features in combination with limited biomarkers may provide an informative classification for routine use. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Hierarchical cluster analysis based on components of histopathologic grade (tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic score), expression of {ER}, cytokeratin 5/6, and {HER}2 amplification identified four breast cancer subgroups in a cohort of 270 cases. Cluster subgroup membership was compared with observed and Adjuvant! Online predicted 10-year survival. Survival characteristics were confirmed in an independent cohort of 300 cases assigned to cluster subgroups using a decision tree model. {RESULTS}: Four distinct breast cancer cluster subgroups (A-D) were identified that were analogous to molecular tumor types and showed a significant association with survival in both the original and validation cohorts (P {\textless} 0.001). There was a striking difference between survival for patients in cluster subgroups A and B with {ER}(+) breast cancer (P {\textless} 0.001). Outcome for all tumor types was well estimated by Adjuvant! Online, with the exception of cluster B {ER}(+) cancers where Adjuvant!

	abstract = {The majority of tumors arising in {BRCA}1 mutation carriers exhibit inactivation of p53, a key effector of cell death after {DNA} damage. Despite the loss of p53, {BRCA}1-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cisplatin, and patients with {BRCA}1-associated ovarian carcinomas experience improved outcomes with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with sporadic cases. Although it is known that chemosensitivity in {BRCA}1-associated cancers is associated with unrepaired {DNA} damage, the specific effector pathway mediating the cellular response to platinum-induced damage in these tumors is poorly understood. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73, encoding a proapoptotic protein that is linked to chemosensitivity in many settings, is upregulated through a novel epigenetic mechanism in both human and murine models of {BRCA}1-associated ovarian carcinoma. {BRCA}1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor {ZEB}1, leading to the abrogation of {ZEB}1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms ({TAp}73). Cisplatin chemotherapy induces {TAp}73 target genes specifically in {BRCA}1-deficient cells, and knockdown of {TAp}73 in these cells causes chemoresistance while having little or no effect on {BRCA}1-expressing tumor cells. In primary ovarian carcinomas, {ZEB}1 binding site methylation and {TAp}73 expression correlate with {BRCA}1 status and with clinical response. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism that supports the contribution of {TAp}73 as an important mediator of the response to platinum chemotherapy in a subset of ovarian carcinomas. {TAp}73 might represent a response predictor and potential therapeutic target for enhancing chemosensitivity in this disease.},

In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of earlier genome-wide gene expression studies to identify pathway-based genes that are associated with therapeutic response. The predictive power of these genes was validated by transcript profiling in diagnostic bone marrow samples from Ph+ {ALL} patients using a quantitative real-time {PCR} array. Gene expression was correlated with cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, including presence of {ABL}1 mutations and {IKZF}1 deletion. A total of 43 de novo Ph+ {ALL} patients treated uniformly with tyrosine kinase inhibitors combined with chemotherapy were selected to validate 46 identified genes. A 9-gene signature was established to distinguish optimal responders from patients with persistent residual disease and early molecular recurrence. The signature was subsequently validated with 87\% predictive accuracy in an independent validation set of patients. When initially optimal responders relapsed, their gene expression patterns also shifted. Optimal responders showed upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis pathways, whereas poor responders had higher expression of genes that facilitate tumor cell survival in hypoxic conditions as well as development of drug resistance. This unique 9-gene signature may better enable stratification of patients to proper therapeutic regimens and provides new insights into mechanisms of Ph+ {ALL} response to therapy.},

	abstract = {Tumor exosomes educate selected host tissues toward a prometastatic phenotype. We demonstrated this for exosomes of the metastatic rat adenocarcinoma {BSp}73ASML ({ASML}), which modulate draining lymph nodes and lung tissue to support settlement of poorly metastatic {BSp}73ASML-{CD}44v4-v7 knockdown ({ASML}-{CD}44v(kd)) cells. Now, we profiled {mRNA} and {microRNA} ({miRNA}) of {ASML}(wt) and {ASML}-{CD}44v(kd) exosomes to define the pathway(s), whereby exosomes prepare the premetastatic niche. {ASML} exosomes, recovered in draining lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection, preferentially are taken up by lymph node stroma cells ({LnStr}) and lung fibroblasts ({LuFb}) that were chosen as exosome targets. {ASML}(wt) and {ASML}-{CD}44v(kd) exosomes contain a restricted {mRNA} and {miRNA} repertoire that differs significantly between the two lines and exosomes thereof due to {CD}44v6 influencing gene and {miRNA} transcription/posttranscriptional regulation. Exosomal {mRNA} and {miRNA} are recovered in target cells, where transferred {miRNA} significantly affected {mRNA} translation. Besides others, this was exemplified for abundant {ASML}(wt)-exosomal {miR}-494 and {miR}-542-3p, which target cadherin-17 (cdh17). Concomitantly, matrix metalloproteinase transcription, accompanying cdh17 down-regulation, was upregulated in {LnStr} transfected with {miR}-494 or {miR}-542-3p or co-cultured with tumor exosomes. Thus, tumor exosomes target non-transformed cells in premetastatic organs and modulate premetastatic organ cells predominantly through transferred {miRNA}, where {miRNA} from a metastasizing tumor prepares premetastatic organ stroma cells for tumor cell hosting. Fitting the demands of metastasizing tumor cells, transferred exosomal {miRNA} mostly affected proteases, adhesion molecules, chemokine ligands, cell cycle- and angiogenesis-promoting genes, and genes engaged in oxidative stress response. The demonstration of function-competent exosomal {miRNA} in host target cells encourages exploiting exosomes as a therapeutic gene delivery system.},

Here we present the first extensive map of human {DHSs} identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify ∼2.9 million {DHSs} that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using {ENCODE} data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, {DNA} methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect ∼580,000 distal {DHSs} with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal {DHSs} and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular {DNase} I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The {DHS} landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the {DHS} compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are nanosized (30-100 nm) membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosomes have been found to contain various {RNA} species including {miRNA}, {mRNA} and long non-protein coding {RNAs}. A number of cancer cells produce elevated levels of exosomes. Because exosomes have been isolated from most body fluids they may provide a source for non-invasive cancer diagnostics. Transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies ({RNA}-Seq) offers enormous amount of data that can be used for biomarkers discovery, however, in case of exosomes this approach was applied only for the analysis of small {RNAs}. In this study, we utilized {RNA}-Seq technology to analyze {RNAs} present in microvesicles secreted by human breast cancer cell lines. Exosomes were isolated from the media conditioned by two human breast cancer cell lines, {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {MDA}-{MB}-436. Exosomal {RNA} was profiled using the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based technology. Exosomes were found to contain various classes of {RNA} with the major class represented by fragmented ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}), in particular 28S and 18S {rRNA} subunits. Analysis of exosomal {RNA} content revealed that it reflects {RNA} content of the donor cells. Although exosomes produced by the two cancer cell lines shared most of the {RNA} species, there was a number of non-coding transcripts unique to {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {MDA}-{MB}-436 cells. This suggests that {RNA} analysis might distinguish exosomes produced by low metastatic breast cancer cell line ({MDA}-{MB}-436) from that produced by highly metastatic breast cancer cell line ({MDA}-{MB}-231). The analysis of gene ontologies ({GOs}) associated with the most abundant transcripts present in exosomes revealed significant enrichment in genes encoding proteins involved in translation and {rRNA} and {ncRNA} processing. These {GO} terms indicate most expressed genes for both, cellular and exosomal {RNA}. For the first time, using {RNA}-seq, we examined the transcriptomes of exosomes secreted by human breast cancer cells. We found that most abundant exosomal {RNA} species are the fragments of 28S and 18S {rRNA} subunits. This limits the number of reads from other {RNAs}. To increase the number of detectable transcripts and improve the accuracy of their expression level the protocols allowing depletion of fragmented {rRNA} should be utilized in the future {RNA}-seq analyses on exosomes. Present data revealed that exosomal transcripts are representative of their cells of origin and thus could form basis for detection of tumor specific markers.},

	abstract = {The tumor microenvironment ({TME}) mediates immunosuppression resulting in tumor cell escape from immune surveillance and cancer vaccine failure. Immunosuppression is mediated by the {STAT}-3 transcription factor, which potentiates signaling in tumor and immune cells. Because immunosuppression continues to be a major inhibitor of cancer vaccine efficacy, we examined in this study whether therapeutically targeted delivery of a synthetic {STAT}-3 inhibitor to the {TME}, combined with an {HER}-2 {DNA} vaccine can improve immune surveillance against {HER}-2(+) breast cancer and prevent its recurrence. To this end, we developed a novel ligand-targeted nanoparticle ({NP}) encapsulating a {CDDO}-Im payload capable of specific delivery to the {TME}, which showed an effective therapeutic inhibition of {STAT}-3 activation in primary tumors. Furthermore, we showed that treatment with these {NPs} resulted in priming of the immune {TME}, characterized by increased {IFN}-γ, p-{STAT}-1, {GM}-{CSF}, {IL}-2, {IL}-15, and {IL}-12b and reduced {TGF}-β, {IL}-6, and {IL}-10 protein expression. In addition, we found significantly increased tumor infiltration by activated {CD}8(+) T cells, M1 macrophages, and dendritic cells. These changes correlated with delayed growth of orthotopic 4TO7 breast tumors and, when combined with an {HER}-2 {DNA} vaccine, prevented {HER}-2(+) primary tumor recurrence in immunocompetent mice. Furthermore, antitumor T-cell responses were enhanced in splenocytes isolated from mice treated with this combination therapy. Together, these data show effective protection from cancer recurrence through improved immune surveillance against a tumor-specific antigen.},

	abstract = {Cancer chromosomal instability ({CIN}) results in an increased rate of change of chromosome number and structure and generates intratumour heterogeneity. {CIN} is observed in most solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance. Understanding a mechanistic basis for {CIN} is therefore paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and increased {DNA} replication stress in {CIN}+ colorectal cancer ({CRC}) cells relative to {CIN}− {CRC} cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three new {CIN}-suppressor genes ({PIGN} (also known as {MCD}4), {MEX}3C ({RKHD}2) and {ZNF}516 ({KIAA}0222)) encoded on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in {CIN}+ {CRC}. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma–carcinoma transition. {CIN}-suppressor gene silencing leads to {DNA} replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage, reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after {CIN}-suppressor gene silencing, and attenuates segregation errors and {DNA} damage in {CIN}+ cells. These data implicate a central role for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical {CIN}, which may inform new therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity.},

While the core protein machinery for {OxPhos} is well characterized, many of its assembly, maturation, and regulatory factors remain unknown. We exploited the tight transcriptional control of the genes encoding the core {OxPhos} machinery to identify novel regulators. We developed a computational procedure, which we call expression screening, which integrates information from thousands of microarray data sets in a principled manner to identify genes that are consistently co-expressed with a target pathway across biological contexts. We applied expression screening to predict dozens of novel regulators of {OxPhos}. For two candidate genes, {CHCHD}2 and {SLIRP}, we show that silencing with {RNAi} results in destabilization of {OxPhos} complexes and a marked loss of {OxPhos} enzymatic activity. Moreover, we show that {SLIRP} plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial-localized {mRNA} transcripts that encode {OxPhos} protein subunits. Our findings provide a catalogue of potential novel {OxPhos} regulators that advance our understanding of the coordination between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes for the regulation of cellular energy metabolism.},

Many of these differences will be due to differences in the activities of transcription factors. In principle, these differences can be detected by associating motifs in promoters with differences in gene expression levels between the groups. In practice, this is hard to do. {RESULTS}: We combine correspondence analysis, between group analysis and co-inertia analysis to determine which motifs, from a database of promoter motifs, are strongly associated with differences in gene expression levels. Given a database of motifs and gene expression levels from a set of arrays, the method produces a ranked list of motifs associated with any specified split in the arrays. We give an example using the Gene Atlas compendium of gene expression levels for human tissues where we search for motifs that are associated with expression in central nervous system ({CNS}) or muscle tissues. Most of the motifs that we find are known from previous work to be strongly associated with expression in {CNS} or muscle. We give a second example using a published prostate cancer dataset where we can simply and clearly find which transcriptional pathways are associated with differences between benign and metastatic samples. {AVAILABILITY}: The source code is freely available upon request from the authors.},

	abstract = {A causal role was recently attributed to inflammation in many malignant diseases, including breast cancer. The different inflammatory mediators that are involved in this disease include cells, cytokines and chemokines. Of these, many studies have addressed the involvement and roles of the inflammatory chemokines {CCL}2 ({MCP}-1) and {CCL}5 ({RANTES}) in breast malignancy. While minimally expressed by normal breast epithelial duct cells, both chemokines are highly expressed by breast tumor cells at primary tumor sites, indicating that {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 expression is acquired in the course of malignant transformation, and suggesting that the two chemokines play a role in breast cancer development and/or progression. Supporting this possibility are findings showing significant associations between {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 and more advanced disease course and progression. Furthermore, studies in animal model systems have shown active and causative roles for the two chemokines in this disease. In line with the tumor-promoting roles of {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 in breast cancer, the two chemokines were shown to mediate many types of tumor-promoting cross-talks between the tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment: (1) they shift the balance at the tumor site between different leukocyte cell types by increasing the presence of deleterious tumor-associated macrophages ({TAM}) and inhibiting potential anti-tumor T cell activities; (2) of the two chemokines, mainly {CCL}2 promotes angiogenesis; (3) {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 which are expressed by cells of the tumor microenvironment osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells play a role in breast metastatic processes. In addition, both chemokines act directly on the tumor cells to promote their pro-malignancy phenotype, by increasing their migratory and invasion-related properties. Together, the overall current information suggests that {CCL}2 and {CCL}5 are inflammatory mediators with pro-malignancy activities in breast cancer, and that they should be considered as potential therapeutic targets for the limitation of this disease.},

We investigated the molecular profiles of Lynch syndrome-associated and sporadic ovarian cancer with the aim to identify key discriminators and central tumorigenic mechanisms in hereditary ovarian cancer. Global gene expression profiling using whole-genome c-{DNA}-mediated Annealing, Selection, extension, and Ligation was applied to 48 histopathologically matched Lynch syndrome-associated and sporadic ovarian cancers. Lynch syndrome-associated and sporadic ovarian cancers differed by 349 significantly deregulated genes, including {PTPRH}, {BIRC}3, {SHH} and {TNFRSF}6B. The genes involved were predominantly linked to cell growth, proliferation, and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction. When stratified for histologic subtype, hierarchical clustering confirmed distinct differences related to heredity in the endometrioid and serous subtypes. Furthermore, separate clustering was achieved in an independent, publically available data set. The distinct genetic signatures in Lynch syndrome-associated and sporadic ovarian cancers point to alternative preferred tumorigenic routes and suggest that genetic discriminators may be relevant for molecular diagnostics and targeted therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Background Single sample predictors ({SSPs}) and Subtype classification models ({SCMs}) are gene expression–based classifiers used to identify the four primary molecular subtypes of breast cancer (basal-like, {HER}2-enriched, luminal A, and luminal B). {SSPs} use hierarchical clustering, followed by nearest centroid classification, based on large sets of tumor-intrinsic genes. {SCMs} use a mixture of Gaussian distributions based on sets of genes with expression specifically correlated with three key breast cancer genes (estrogen receptor [{ER}], {HER}2, and aurora kinase A [{AURKA}]). The aim of this study was to compare the robustness, classification concordance, and prognostic value of these classifiers with those of a simplified three-gene {SCM} in a large compendium of microarray datasets.
Methods Thirty-six publicly available breast cancer datasets (n = 5715) were subjected to molecular subtyping using five published classifiers (three {SSPs} and two {SCMs}) and {SCMGENE}, the new three-gene ({ER}, {HER}2, and {AURKA}) {SCM}. We used the prediction strength statistic to estimate robustness of the classification models, defined as the capacity of a classifier to assign the same tumors to the same subtypes independently of the dataset used to fit it. We used Cohen κ and Cramer V coefficients to assess concordance between the subtype classifiers and association with clinical variables, respectively. We used Kaplan–Meier survival curves and cross-validated partial likelihood to compare prognostic value of the resulting classifications. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results {SCMs} were statistically significantly more robust than {SSPs}, with {SCMGENE} being the most robust because of its simplicity. {SCMGENE} was statistically significantly concordant with published {SCMs} (κ = 0.65–0.70) and {SSPs} (κ = 0.34–0.59), statistically significantly associated with {ER} (V = 0.64), {HER}2 (V = 0.52) status, and histological grade (V = 0.55), and yielded similar strong prognostic value.
Conclusion Our results suggest that adequate classification of the major and clinically relevant molecular subtypes of breast cancer can be robustly achieved with quantitative measurements of three key genes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization ({NMF}) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, including signal processing, face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of {NMF} in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in {NMF} theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most {NMF} implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community.
{RESULTS}: Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard {NMF} algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new {NMF} methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/{BioConductor} platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published {NMF} algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new {NMF} strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {NMF} package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications. Documentation, source code and sample data are available from {CRAN}.},

The analytical sensitivity was estimated to be at least 110 genome copies per amplification reaction. The microarray test correctly detected 95.2\% of mutations for which there was a sequence-specific probe on the microarray and 100\% of 96 wild-type sequences. In a blinded analysis of 153 clinical isolates, microarray sensitivity for first-line drugs relative to phenotypic {DST} (true resistance) was 100\% for rifampin ({RIF}) (14/14), 90.0\% for isoniazid ({INH}) (36/40), 70\% for ethambutol ({EMB}) (7/10), and 89.1\% (57/64) combined. Microarray specificity (true susceptibility) for first-line agents was 95.0\% for {RIF} (132/139), 98.2\% for {INH} (111/113), and 98.6\% for {EMB} (141/143). Overall microarray specificity for {RIF}, {INH}, and {EMB} combined was 97.2\% (384/395). The overall positive and negative predictive values for {RIF}, {INH}, and {EMB} combined were 84.9\% and 98.3\%, respectively. For the second-line drug streptomycin ({STR}), overall concordance between the agar proportion method and microarray analysis was 89.5\% (137/153). Sensitivity was 34.8\% (8/23) because of limited microarray coverage for {STR}-conferring mutations, and specificity was 99.2\% (129/130). All false-susceptible discrepant results were a consequence of {DNA} mutations that are not represented by a specific microarray probe. There were zero invalid results from 220 total tests. The simplified microarray system is suitable for detecting resistance-conferring mutations in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates and can now be used for prospective trials or integrated into an all-in-one, closed-amplicon consumable.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The International Metastatic Renal-Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium model offers prognostic information for patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. We tested the accuracy of the model in an external population and compared it with other prognostic models.
{METHODS}: We included patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma who were treated with first-line {VEGF}-targeted treatment at 13 international cancer centres and who were registered in the Consortium's database but had not contributed to the initial development of the Consortium Database model. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We compared the Database Consortium model with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation ({CCF}) model, the International Kidney Cancer Working Group ({IKCWG}) model, the French model, and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ({MSKCC}) model by concordance indices and other measures of model fit.
{FINDINGS}: Overall, 1028 patients were included in this study, of whom 849 had complete data to assess the Database Consortium model. Median overall survival was 18·8 months (95\% 17·6-21·4). The predefined Database Consortium risk factors (anaemia, thrombocytosis, neutrophilia, hypercalcaemia, Karnofsky performance status {\textless}80\%, and {\textless}1 year from diagnosis to treatment) were independent predictors of poor overall survival in the external validation set (hazard ratios ranged between 1·27 and 2·08, concordance index 0·71, 95\% {CI} 0·68-0·73). When patients were segregated into three risk categories, median overall survival was 43·2 months (95\% {CI} 31·4-50·1) in the favourable risk group (no risk factors; 157 patients), 22·5 months (18·7-25·1) in the intermediate risk group (one to two risk factors; 440 patients), and 7·8 months (6·5-9·7) in the poor risk group (three or more risk factors; 252 patients; p{\textless}0·0001; concordance index 0·664, 95\% {CI} 0·639-0·689). 672 patients had complete data to test all five models. The concordance index of the {CCF} model was 0·662 (95\% {CI} 0·636-0·687), of the French model 0·640 (0·614-0·665), of the {IKCWG} model 0·668 (0·645-0·692), and of the {MSKCC} model 0·657 (0·632-0·682). The reported versus predicted number of deaths at 2 years was most similar in the Database Consortium model compared with the other models.
{INTERPRETATION}: The Database Consortium model is now externally validated and can be applied to stratify patients by risk in clinical trials and to counsel patients about prognosis.

	abstract = {Metastatic prostate and breast cancers display a predilection for the skeleton. The high incidence of skeletal metastasis may be a reflection of favorable reciprocal interactions between the bone microenvironment and disseminated cancer cells. Here we show that bone-metastatic {PC}3-{ML} prostate cancer cells and {MDA}-231 breast cancer cells-when co-cultured with human osteoblasts-down-regulate the increase in cytosolic free calcium (Ca(2+)) induced by agonist stimulation. This osteoblast promoted alteration of Ca(2+) signaling develops and reverts in a time-dependent manner. Most importantly, the Ca(2+) responses of cancer cells lacking bone metastatic potential are not affected by osteoblasts. The limited increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) observed in bone-metastatic cells does not result from depleted intracellular Ca(2+) stores but rather a decreased entry of Ca(2+) from the extracellular space. Interestingly, the inhibition of histone deacetylase in cancer cells replicates the changes in Ca(2+) signaling induced by osteoblasts, suggesting the participation of epigenetic mechanisms. Finally, cancer cells harvested from skeletal metastases induced in mice showed Ca(2+) responses identical to cells co-cultured with osteoblasts. However, Ca(2+) signaling in cancer cells recovered from metastases to soft-tissues was not affected, emphasizing the role of the bone microenvironment in regulating the functional behavior of bone-metastatic cells. We propose that osteoblasts protect selected malignant phenotypes from cell death caused by an excessive increase in cytosolic Ca(2+), thereby facilitating their progression into macroscopic skeletal metastases.},

	abstract = {Neuroendocrine tumors ({NETs}) describe a heterogeneous group of tumors with a wide range of morphologic, functional, and behavioral characteristics. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ({pNET}) are a subset of {NETs} which are increasing in incidence and prevalence. These tumors are generally slow growing and behave in an indolent fashion. However, when these tumors spread they can be life threatening and difficult to treat with current modalities. In 2011, the landscape of treatment for {pNET} was changed with the approval of two targeted agents, sunitinib and everolimus, the first new therapies for this disease in over 20 years. Data from these clinical trials and extensive preclinical work into the underlying molecular pathways in neuroendocrine tumors has generated intense interest in the quest to identify additional effective agents in this challenging disease. At the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology ({ASCO}) Annual Meeting, several researchers presented updated data regarding the use of targeted agents, alternative chemotherapeutic agents and combinations of these in the treatment of {pNET}. Corrie et al. (Abstract \#4121) reported data from a chemotherapy clinical trial replacing 5-{FU} with capecitabine and evaluating the addition of cisplatin in {NETs}. Several authors reviewed the addition of the anti {VEGF} monoclonal antibody bevacizumab into combination therapy. Ducreux et al (Abstract \#4036) presented results from a trial of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab while Firdaus et al. (Abstract \#4127) reported the results of combination therapy with octreotide, bevacizumab, and pertuzumab. Hobday et al. (Abstract \#4048) reported positive results of an interim analysis of combination therapy with an {mTOR} inhibitor and bevacizumab. Kulke et al (Abstract \#4125) reported the results of a clinical trial utilizing an antibody targeting the insulin growth factor receptor. Finally, Vinik et al. (Abstract \#4118) provided updated survival data form the seminal phase {III} trial that led to approval of sunitinib in the treatment of {pNET}. The authors review and summarize these abstracts in this article.},

Unlike {AKT}1 mutations that were absent from cell lines, {PIK}3CA (39\%) and {PTEN} (20\%) mutations were more common in cell lines than tumors, suggesting a selection for these but not {AKT}1 mutations during adaptation to culture. {PIK}3CA mutations did not have a significant effect on outcome after adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in 157 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. {PIK}3CA mutations, in comparison with {PTEN} loss and {AKT}1 mutations, were associated with significantly less and inconsistent activation of {AKT} and of downstream {PI}3K/{AKT} signaling in tumors and cell lines. {PTEN} loss and {PIK}3CA mutation were frequently concordant, suggesting different contributions to pathophysiology. {PTEN} loss rendered cells significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by the {PI}3K inhibitor {LY}294002 than did {PIK}3CA mutations. Thus, {PI}3K pathway aberrations likely play a distinct role in the pathogenesis of different breast cancer subtypes. The specific aberration present may have implications for the selection of {PI}3K-targeted therapies in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.},

To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging ({CS}-{BLI}) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. {CS}-{BLI} is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, {NF}-{kappaB}, {HIF}-1alpha, myc, {hTERT} and {IRF}4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, {CS}-{BLI} can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of {CS}-{BLI}, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.},

Luga and colleagues have described the production of exosomes by stromal cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts that are taken up by breast cancer cells and are then loaded with Wnt 11, which is associated with stimulation of the invasiveness and metastasis of the breast cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that exosomes produced by breast cancer cells are taken up by stromal fibroblasts and other stromal cells, suggesting that exosomes are agents of cross-talk between cancer and stromal cells to stimulate metastasis. Imaging of exosomes by labeling with fluorescent proteins will enlighten the process by which exosomes enhance metastasis, including premetastatic niche formation.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Previous studies of breast tissue gene expression have shown that the extratumoral microenvironment has substantial variability across individuals, some of which can be attributed to epidemiologic factors. To evaluate how mammographic density and breast tissue composition relate to extratumoral microenvironment gene expression, we used data on 121 patients with breast cancer from the population-based Polish Women's Breast Cancer Study.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Breast cancer cases were classified on the basis of a previously reported, biologically defined extratumoral gene expression signature with two subtypes: an Active subtype, which is associated with high expression of genes related to fibrosis and wound response, and an Inactive subtype, which has high expression of cellular adhesion genes. Mammographic density of the contralateral breast was assessed using pretreatment mammograms and a quantitative, reliable computer-assisted thresholding method. Breast tissue composition was evaluated on the basis of digital image analysis of tissue sections.
{RESULTS}: The Inactive extratumoral subtype was associated with significantly higher percentage mammographic density ({PD}) and dense area ({DA}) in univariate analysis ({PD}: P = 0.001; {DA}: P = 0.049) and in multivariable analyses adjusted for age and body mass index ({PD}: P = 0.004; {DA}: P = 0.049). Inactive/higher mammographic density tissue was characterized by a significantly higher percentage of stroma and a significantly lower percentage of adipose tissue, with no significant change in epithelial content. Analysis of published gene expression signatures suggested that Inactive/higher mammographic density tissue expressed increased estrogen response and decreased {TGF}-β signaling.
{CONCLUSIONS}: By linking novel molecular phenotypes with mammographic density, our results indicate that mammographic density reflects broad transcriptional changes, including changes in both epithelia- and stroma-derived signaling. Clin Cancer Res; 19(18); 4972-82. ©2013 {AACR}.},

	doi = {10.3791/3037},
	abstract = {The field of exosome research is rapidly expanding, with a dramatic increase in publications in recent years. These small vesicles (30-100 nm) of endocytic origin were first proposed to function as a way for reticulocytes to eradicate the transferrin receptor while maturing into erythrocytes, and were later named exosomes. Exosomes are formed by inward budding of late endosomes, producing multivesicular bodies ({MVBs}), and are released into the environment by fusion of the {MVBs} with the plasma membrane. Since the first discovery of exosomes, a wide range of cells have been shown to release these vesicles. Exosomes have also been detected in several biological fluids, including plasma, nasal lavage fluid, saliva and breast milk. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the content and function of exosomes depends on the originating cell and the conditions under which they are produced. A variety of functions have been demonstrated for exosomes, such as induction of tolerance against allergen, eradication of established tumors in mice, inhibition and activation of natural killer cells, promotion of differentiation into T regulatory cells, stimulation of T cell proliferation and induction of T cell apoptosis. Year 2007 we demonstrated that exosomes released from mast cells contain messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) and {microRNA} ({miRNA}), and that the {RNA} can be shuttled from one cell to another via exosomes. In the recipient cells, the {mRNA} shuttled by exosomes was shown to be translated into protein, suggesting a regulatory function of the transferred {RNA}. Further, we have also shown that exosomes derived from cells grown under oxidative stress can induce tolerance against further stress in recipient cells and thus suggest a biological function of the exosomal shuttle {RNA}. Cell culture media and biological fluids contain a mixture of vesicles and shed fragments. A high quality isolation method for exosomes, followed by characterization and identification of the exosomes and their content, is therefore crucial to distinguish exosomes from other vesicles and particles. Here, we present a method for the isolation of exosomes from both cell culture medium and body fluids. This isolation method is based on repeated centrifugation and filtration steps, followed by a final ultracentrifugation step in which the exosomes are pelleted. Important methods to identify the exosomes and characterize the exosomal morphology and protein content are highlighted, including electron microscopy, flow cytometry and Western blot. The purification of the total exosomal {RNA} is based on spin column chromatography and the exosomal {RNA} yield and size distribution is analyzed using a Bioanalyzer.},

Genetic components balancing these opposing activities are likely to require tight regulation, because even subtle alterations in their expression may disrupt this balance with major consequences for various cancer-associated phenotypes. Here, we describe a cassette of cancer-specific genes exhibiting precise transcriptional control in solid tumors. Mining a database of tumor gene expression profiles from six different tissues, we identified 48 genes exhibiting highly restricted levels of gene expression variation in tumors (n = 270) compared to nonmalignant tissues (n = 71). Comprising genes linked to multiple cancer-related pathways, the restricted expression of this "Poised Gene Cassette" ({PGC}) was robustly validated across 11 independent cohorts of approximately 1,300 samples from multiple cancer types. In three separate experimental models, subtle alterations in {PGC} expression were consistently associated with significant differences in metastatic and invasive potential. We functionally confirmed this association in {siRNA} knockdown experiments of five {PGC} genes (p53CSV, {MAP}3K11, {MTCH}2, {CPSF}6, and {SKIP}), which either directly enhanced the invasive capacities or inhibited the proliferation of {AGS} cancer cells. In primary tumors, similar subtle alterations in {PGC} expression were also repeatedly associated with clinical outcome in multiple cohorts. Taken collectively, these findings support the existence of a common set of precisely controlled genes in solid tumors. Since inducing small activity changes in these genes may prove sufficient to potently influence various tumor phenotypes such as metastasis, targeting such precisely regulated genes may represent a promising avenue for novel anti-cancer therapies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}
With the popularization of high-throughput techniques, the need for procedures that help in the biological interpretation of results has increased enormously. Recently, new procedures inspired in systems biology criteria have started to be developed.

{RESULTS}
Here we present {FatiScan}, a web-based program which implements a threshold-independent test for the functional interpretation of large-scale experiments that does not depend on the pre-selection of genes based on the multiple application of independent tests to each gene. The test implemented aims to directly test the behaviour of blocks of functionally related genes, instead of focusing on single genes. In addition, the test does not depend on the type of the data used for obtaining significance values, and consequently different types of biologically informative terms (gene ontology, pathways, functional motifs, transcription factor binding sites or regulatory sites from {CisRed}) can be applied to different classes of genome-scale studies. We exemplify its application in microarray gene expression, evolution and interactomics.

{CONCLUSION}
Methods for gene set enrichment which, in addition, are independent from the original data and experimental design constitute a promising alternative for the functional profiling of genome-scale experiments. A web server that performs the test described and other similar ones can be found at: http://www.babelomics.org.},

	abstract = {One of the major limitations of studying cancer-bone metastasis has been the lack of an appropriate ex-vivo model which can be used under defined conditions that simulates closely the in vivo live bone microenvironment in response to cancer-bone interactions. We have developed and utilized a three-dimensional (3D) cancer-bone metastasis model using free-floating live mouse calvarial bone organs in the presence of cancer cells in a roller tube system. In such co-cultures under hypoxia and a specifically defined bone remodeling stage, viz., resorption system, cancer cells showed a remarkable affinity and specificity for the "endosteal side" of the bone where they colonize and proliferate. This was concurrent with differentiation of resident stem/progenitor cells to osteoclasts and bone resorption. In contrast, under bone formation conditions this model revealed different pathophysiology where the breast cancer cells continued to induce osteoclastic bone resorption whereas prostate cancer cells led to osteoblastic bone formation. The current 3D model was used to demonstrate its application to studies involving chemical and biochemical perturbations in the absence and presence of cancer cells and cellular responses. We describe proof-of-principle with examples of the broad versatility and multi-faceted application of this model that adds another dimension to the ongoing studies in the cancer-bone metastasis arena.},

	abstract = {Despite recent large-scale profiling efforts, the best prognostic predictor of glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}) remains the patient's age at diagnosis. We describe a global pattern of tumor-exclusive co-occurring copy-number alterations ({CNAs}) that is correlated, possibly coordinated with {GBM} patients' survival and response to chemotherapy. The pattern is revealed by {GSVD} comparison of patient-matched but probe-independent {GBM} and normal {aCGH} datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}). We find that, first, the {GSVD}, formulated as a framework for comparatively modeling two composite datasets, removes from the pattern copy-number variations ({CNVs}) that occur in the normal human genome (e.g., female-specific X chromosome amplification) and experimental variations (e.g., in tissue batch, genomic center, hybridization date and scanner), without a-priori knowledge of these variations. Second, the pattern includes most known {GBM}-associated changes in chromosome numbers and focal {CNAs}, as well as several previously unreported {CNAs} in {\textgreater}3\% of the patients.

Third, the pattern provides a better prognostic predictor than the chromosome numbers or any one focal {CNA} that it identifies, suggesting that the {GBM} survival phenotype is an outcome of its global genotype. The pattern is independent of age, and combined with age, makes a better predictor than age alone. {GSVD} comparison of matched profiles of a larger set of {TCGA} patients, inclusive of the initial set, confirms the global pattern. {GSVD} classification of the {GBM} profiles of an independent set of patients validates the prognostic contribution of the pattern.},

	abstract = {Extracellular vesicles ({EVs}), including exosomes, have been widely recognized for their role in intercellular communication of the immune response system. In the past few years, significance has been given to exosomes in the induction and modulation of cell-fate-inducing signalling pathways, such as the Hedgehog (Hh), Wnts, Notch, transforming growth factor ({TGF}-β), epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) and fibroblast growth factor ({FGF}) pathways, placing them in the wider context of development and also of cancer. These protein families induce signalling cascades responsible for tissue specification, homeostasis and maintenance. Exosomes contribute to cell-fate signal secretion, and vice versa exosome secretion can be induced by these proteins. Interestingly, exosomes can also transfer their {mRNA} to host cells or modulate the signalling pathways directly by the removal of downstream effector molecules from the cell. Surprisingly, much of what we know about the function of exosomes in cell determination is gathered from pathological transformed cancer cells and wound healing while data about their biogenesis and biology in normal developing and adult tissue lag behind. In this report, we will summarize some of the published literature and point to current advances and questions in this fast-developing topic. In a brief foray, we will also update and shortly discuss their potential in diagnosis and targeted cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Prognosis of ovarian carcinoma is poor, heterogeneous, and not accurately predicted by histoclinical features. We analysed gene expression profiles of ovarian carcinomas to identify a multigene expression model associated with survival after platinum-based therapy.


{METHODS}

Data from 401 ovarian carcinoma samples were analysed. The learning set included 35 cases profiled using whole-genome {DNA} chips. The validation set included 366 cases from five independent public data sets.


{RESULTS}

Whole-genome unsupervised analysis could not distinguish poor from good prognosis samples. By supervised analysis, we built a seven-gene optimal prognostic model ({OPM}) out of 94 genes identified as associated with progression-free survival. Using the {OPM}, we could classify patients in two groups with different overall survival ({OS}) not only in the learning set, but also in the validation set. Five-year {OS} was 57 and 27\% for the predicted 'Favourable' and 'Unfavourable' classes, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the {OPM} outperformed the individual current prognostic factors, both in the learning and the validation sets, and added independent prognostic information.


{CONCLUSION}

We defined a seven-gene model associated with outcome in 401 ovarian carcinomas. Prospective studies are warranted to confirm its prognostic value, and explore its potential ability for better tailoring systemic therapies in advanced-stage tumours.},

	abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death for women in the U.S. and the seventh most fatal worldwide. Although ovarian cancer is notable for its initial sensitivity to platinum-based therapies, the vast majority of patients eventually develop recurrent cancer and succumb to increasingly platinum-resistant disease. Modern, targeted cancer drugs intervene in cell signaling, and identifying key disease mechanisms and pathways would greatly advance our treatment abilities. In order to shed light on the molecular diversity of ovarian cancer, we performed comprehensive transcriptional profiling on 129 advanced stage, high grade serous ovarian cancers. We implemented a, re-sampling based version of the {ISIS} class discovery algorithm ({rISIS}: robust {ISIS}) and applied it to the entire set of ovarian cancer transcriptional profiles. {rISIS} identified a previously undescribed patient stratification, further supported by micro-{RNA} expression profiles, and gene set enrichment analysis found strong biological support for the stratification by extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis genes. The corresponding "angiogenesis signature" was validated in ten published independent ovarian cancer gene expression datasets and is significantly associated with overall survival. The subtypes we have defined are of potential translational interest as they may be relevant for identifying patients who may benefit from the addition of anti-angiogenic therapies that are now being tested in clinical trials.},

We investigated the possible role of {CART} in mammary cancer-induced anorexia and body weight loss in rats. Mammary carcinogenesis was induced in the female Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea ({MNU}). Following administration of {MNU}, rats progressively showed a reduction in food intake and body weight. Fourteen weeks after {MNU} treatment, rats were injected daily with {CART} or {CART}-antibody intracerebroventricularly for 5days, and food intake and body weight were monitored (g) before the next injection time-point. In normal rats, while a distinct anorexia and weight loss was observed following {CART} administration, injection of {CART}-antibody produced opposite effects. However, both the agents failed to produce any significant alterations in food intake and body weight of mammary tumor-bearing animals. An immunohistochemical application of antibodies against {CART} to the brain sections of cancerous rats showed a reduced immunoreactivity in the hypothalamic dorsomedial, ventromedial, lateral, paraventricular and arcuate nuclei. The results suggest that, cancerous condition might down-regulate the {CART} system in the hypothalamus. Alternatively, reduction in hypothalamic {CART} activity might be a counter-regulatory strategy to reverse food under-consumption or body mass erosion.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) regulate target gene expression by controlling their {mRNAs} post-transcriptionally. Increasing evidence demonstrates that {miRNAs} play important roles in various biological processes. However, the functions and precise regulatory mechanisms of most {miRNAs} remain elusive. Current research suggests that {miRNA} regulatory modules are complicated, including up-, down-, and mix-regulation for different physiological conditions. Previous computational approaches for discovering {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions focus only on down-regulatory modules. In this work, we present a method to capture complex {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions including all regulatory types between {miRNAs} and {mRNAs}. {RESULTS} We present a method to capture complex {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions using Bayesian network structure learning with splitting-averaging strategy. It is designed to explore all possible {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions by integrating {miRNA}-targeting information, expression profiles of {miRNAs} and {mRNAs}, and sample categories. We also present an analysis of data sets for epithelial and mesenchymal transition ({EMT}). Our results show that the proposed method identified all possible types of {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions from the data. Many interactions are of tremendous biological significance. Some discoveries have been validated by previous research, for example, the {miR}-200 family negatively regulates {ZEB}1 and {ZEB}2 for {EMT}. Some are consistent with the literature, such as {LOX} has wide interactions with the {miR}-200 family members for {EMT}. Furthermore, many novel interactions are statistically significant and worthy of validation in the near future. {CONCLUSIONS} This paper presents a new method to explore the complex {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions for different physiological conditions using Bayesian network structure learning with splitting-averaging strategy. The method makes use of heterogeneous data including {miRNA}-targeting information, expression profiles of {miRNAs} and {mRNAs}, and sample categories. Results on {EMT} data sets show that the proposed method uncovers many known {miRNA} targets as well as new potentially promising {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions. These interactions could not be achieved by the normal Bayesian network structure learning.},

Emerging evidence suggests communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment occurs via exosomes. This study aimed to clarify whether hypoxia affects angiogenic function through exosomes secreted from leukemia cells. We used the human leukemia cell line K562 for exosome-generating cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ({HUVECs}) for exosome target cells. Exosomes derived from K562 cells cultured under normoxic (20\%) or hypoxic (1\%) conditions for 24 h were isolated and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis. These exosomes were then cocultured with {HUVECs} to evaluate angiogenic activity. The exosomes secreted from K562 cells in hypoxic conditions significantly enhanced tube formation by {HUVECs} compared with exosomes produced in normoxic conditions. Using a {TaqMan} low-density {miRNA} array, we found a subset of {miRNAs}, including {miR}-210, were significantly increased in exosomes secreted from hypoxic K562 cells. We demonstrated that cancer cells and their exosomes have altered {miRNA} profiles under hypoxic conditions.

Here, we developed a 3D microfluidic model to analyze the specificity of human breast cancer metastases to bone, recreating a vascularized osteo-cell conditioned microenvironment with human osteo-differentiated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. The tri-culture system allowed us to study the transendothelial migration of highly metastatic breast cancer cells and to monitor their behavior within the bone-like matrix. Extravasation, quantified 24 h after cancer cell injection, was significantly higher in the osteo-cell conditioned microenvironment compared to collagen gel-only matrices (77.5 ± 3.7\% vs. 37.6 ± 7.3\%), and the migration distance was also significantly greater (50.8 ± 6.2 μm vs. 31.8 ± 5.0 μm). Extravasated cells proliferated to form micrometastases of various sizes containing 4 to more than 60 cells by day 5. We demonstrated that the breast cancer cell receptor {CXCR}2 and the bone-secreted chemokine {CXCL}5 play a major role in the extravasation process, influencing extravasation rate and traveled distance. Our study provides novel 3D in vitro quantitative data on extravasation and micrometastasis generation of breast cancer cells within a bone-like microenvironment and demonstrates the potential value of microfluidic systems to better understand cancer biology and screen for new therapeutics.},

These two major tumor subtypes express markers corresponding to the major differentiation states of epithelial cells in the breast: luminal ({EpCAM}(+)) and basal/myoepithelial ({CD}10(+)). However, there are also rare types of breast cancers, such as metaplastic carcinomas, where tumor cells exhibit features of alternate cell types that no longer resemble breast epithelium. Until now, it has been difficult to identify the cell type(s) in the human breast that gives rise to these various forms of breast cancer. Here we report that transformation of {EpCAM}(+) epithelial cells results in the formation of common forms of human breast cancer, including estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative tumors with luminal and basal-like characteristics, respectively, whereas transformation of {CD}10(+) cells results in the development of rare metaplastic tumors reminiscent of the claudin-low subtype. We also demonstrate the existence of {CD}10(+) breast cells with metaplastic traits that can give rise to skin and epidermal tissues. Furthermore, we show that the development of metaplastic breast cancer is attributable, in part, to the transformation of these metaplastic breast epithelial cells. These findings identify normal cellular precursors to human breast cancers and reveal the existence of a population of cells with epidermal progenitor activity within adult human breast tissues.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular environment by various types of cells, including tumor cells. Exosomes are enriched with a discrete set of cellular proteins, and therefore expected to exert diverse biological functions according to cell origin. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) possess the potential for differentiation into multilineages and can also function as precursors for tumor stroma including myofibroblast that provides a favorable environment for tumor progression. Although a close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a neoplastic tumor microenvironment has already been revealed, how this communication works is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of tumor cell-derived exosomes on {MSCs} by treating adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}) with breast cancer-derived exosomes. The exosome-treated {ADSCs} exhibited the phenotypes of tumor-associated myofibroblasts with increased expression of α-{SMA}. Exosome treatment also induced increased expression of tumor-promoting factors {SDF}-1, {VEGF}, {CCL}5 and {TGFβ}. This phenomenon was correlated with increased expression of {TGFβ} receptor I and {II}. Analysis of {SMAD}2, a key player in the {TGFβ} receptor-mediated {SMAD} pathway, revealed that its phosphorylation was increased by exosome treatment and was inhibited by treatment with {SB}431542, an inhibitor of the {SMAD}-mediated pathway, resulting in decreased expression of α-{SMA}. Taken together, our results show that tumor-derived exosomes induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} via the {SMAD}-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that tumor-derived exosomes can contribute to progression and malignancy of tumor cells by converting {MSCs} within tumor stroma into tumor-associated myofibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.},

	abstract = {{MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Although {miRNAs} can function as both tumour suppressors and oncogenes in tumour development, a widespread downregulation of {miRNAs} is commonly observed in human cancers and promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. This indicates an inherent significance of small {RNAs} in tumour suppression. However, the connection between tumour suppressor networks and {miRNA} biogenesis machineries has not been investigated in depth. Here we show that a central tumour suppressor, p53, enhances the post-transcriptional maturation of several {miRNAs} with growth-suppressive function, including {miR}-16-1, {miR}-143 and {miR}-145, in response to {DNA} damage. In {HCT}116 cells and human diploid fibroblasts, p53 interacts with the Drosha processing complex through the association with {DEAD}-box {RNA} helicase p68 (also known as {DDX}5) and facilitates the processing of primary {miRNAs} to precursor {miRNAs}. We also found that transcriptionally inactive p53 mutants interfere with a functional assembly between Drosha complex and p68, leading to attenuation of {miRNA} processing activity. These findings suggest that transcription-independent modulation of {miRNA} biogenesis is intrinsically embedded in a tumour suppressive program governed by p53. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of p53 in {miRNA} processing, which may underlie key aspects of cancer biology.},

A similar interaction occurs between the various cells of the stromal compartment. Crucial for our understanding of tumor or mammary gland ecosystems are the mutual interactions between cells of the epithelial and cells of the stromal compartment. An update is provided for endothelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophages that are implicated in angiogenesis, desmoplasia and inflammation respectively. At the level of the organism, distant ecosystems, comprising primary tumor site, sites of metastasis, bone marrow and endocrine glands among others, are in continuous contact through circulating cells and soluble ligands.

However, standard approaches for mapping the resulting sequencing reads generally ignore alternative sources of expression other than the host cell and are little equipped to address the problems arising from redundancies and gaps among sequenced microbe and virus genomes. We show that screening of sequencing reads for contaminations and infections can be performed easily using {ContextMap}, our recently developed mapping software. Based on mapping–derived statistics, mapping confidence, similarities and misidentifications (e.g. due to missing genome sequences) of species/strains can be assessed. Performance of our approach is evaluated on three real–life sequencing data sets and compared to state–of–the–art metagenomics tools. In particular, {ContextMap} vastly outperformed {GASiC} and {GRAMMy} in terms of runtime. In contrast to {MEGAN}4, it was capable of providing individual read mappings to species and resolving non–unique mappings, thus allowing the identification of misalignments caused by sequence similarities between genomes and missing genome sequences. Our study illustrates the importance and potentials of routinely mining {RNA}–seq experiments for infections or contaminations by microbes and viruses. By using {ContextMap}, gene expression of infecting agents can be analyzed and novel insights in infection processes and tumorigenesis can be obtained.},

	abstract = {Polo-like kinases ({PLKs}) play an important role in cell cycle progression, checkpoint control and mitosis. The high mitotic index and chromosomal instability of advanced cancers suggest that {PLK} inhibitors may be an attractive therapeutic option for presently incurable advanced neoplasias with systemic involvement, such as multiple myeloma ({MM}). We studied the {PLK} 1, 2, 3 inhibitor {BI} 2536 and observed potent ({IC}50{\textless}40 {nM}) and rapid (commitment to cell death {\textless}24 hrs) in vitro activity against {MM} cells in isolation, as well as in vivo activity against a traditional subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Tumor cells in {MM} patients, however, don't exist in isolation, but reside in and interact with the bone microenvironment. Therefore conventional in vitro and in vivo preclinical assays don't take into account how interactions between {MM} cells and the bone microenvironment can potentially confer drug resistance. To probe this question, we performed tumor cell compartment-specific bioluminescence imaging assays to compare the preclinical anti-{MM} activity of {BI} 2536 in vitro in the presence vs. absence of stromal cells or osteoclasts. We observed that the presence of these bone marrow non-malignant cells led to decreased anti-{MM} activity of {BI} 2536. We further validated these results in an orthotopic in vivo mouse model of diffuse {MM} bone lesions where tumor cells interact with non-malignant cells of the bone microenvironment. We again observed that {BI} 2536 had decreased activity in this in vivo model of tumor-bone microenvironment interactions highlighting that, despite {BI} 2536's promising activity in conventional assays, its lack of activity in microenvironmental models raises concerns for its clinical development for {MM}. More broadly, preclinical drug testing in the absence of relevant tumor microenvironment interactions may overestimate potential clinical activity, thus explaining at least in part the gap between preclinical vs. clinical efficacy in {MM} and other cancers.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Several authors have underscored a strong relation between the molecular subtypes and the axillary status of breast cancer patients. The aim of our work was to decipher the interaction between this classification and the probability of a positive sentinel node biopsy.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Our dataset consisted of a total number of 2654 early-stage breast cancer patients. Patients treated at first by conservative breast surgery plus sentinel node biopsies were selected. A multivariate logistic regression model was trained and validated. Interaction covariate between {ER} and {HER}2 markers was a forced input of this model. The performance of the multivariate model in the training and the two validation sets was analyzed in terms of discrimination and calibration. Probability of axillary metastasis was detailed for each molecular subtype.
{RESULTS}: The interaction covariate between {ER} and {HER}2 status was a stronger predictor (p = 0.0031) of positive sentinel node biopsy than the {ER} status by itself (p = 0.016). A multivariate model to determine the probability of sentinel node positivity was defined with the following variables; tumour size, lympho-vascular invasion, molecular subtypes and age at diagnosis. This model showed similar results in terms of discrimination ({AUC} = 0.72/0.73/0.72) and calibration ({HL} p = 0.28/0.05/0.11) in the training and validation sets. The interaction between molecular subtypes, tumour size and sentinel nodes status was approximated.
{DISCUSSION}: We showed that biologically-driven analyses are able to build new models with higher performance in terms of breast cancer axillary status prediction. The molecular subtype classification strongly interacts with the axillary and distant metastasis process.},

	abstract = {Ovarian cancer cells express both estrogen receptor α ({ERα}) and {ERβ}, and hormonal therapy is an attractive treatment option because of its relatively few side effects. However, estrogen was previously shown to have opposite effects in tumors expressing {ERα} compared with {ERβ}, indicating that the two receptor subtypes may have opposing effects. This may explain the modest response to nonselective estrogen inhibition in clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of selectively targeting each {ER} subtype on ovarian cancer growth. Ovarian cancer cell lines {SKOV}3 and {OV}2008, expressing both {ER} subtypes, were treated with highly selective {ER} modulators. Sodium 3'-(1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium)-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate ({XTT}) assay revealed that treatment with 1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride ({MPP}) ({ERα} antagonist) or 2,3-bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionitrile ({DPN}) ({ERβ} agonist) significantly suppressed cell growth in both cell lines. In contrast, 4,4',4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol ({PPT}) ({ERα} agonist) or 4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]-pyrimidin-3-yl]phenol ({PHTPP}) ({ERβ} antagonist) significantly enhanced cell growth. These results were confirmed on a xenograft model where {SKOV}3 cells were injected s.c. into ovariectomized mice. We observed that the average size of xenografts in both the {DPN}-treated group and the {MPP}-treated group was significantly smaller than that for the vehicle-treated group. In addition, we found that phospho-{AKT} expressions in {SKOV}3 cells were reduced by 80\% after treatment with {MPP} and {DPN}, indicating that the {AKT} pathway was involved. The combined treatment with {MPP} and {DPN} had a synergistic effect in suppressing ovarian cancer cell growth. Our findings indicate that targeting {ER} subtypes may enhance the response to hormonal treatment in women with ovarian cancer.},

Several molecular classifications of breast cancers based on expression profiling have been proposed as alternatives. However, their reliability and clinical utility have been repeatedly questioned, notably because most of them were derived from relatively small initial patient populations. We analyzed the transcriptomes of 537 breast tumors using three unsupervised classification methods. A core subset of 355 tumors was assigned to six clusters by all three methods. These six subgroups overlapped with previously defined molecular classes of breast cancer, but also showed important differences, notably the absence of an {ERBB}2 subgroup and the division of the large luminal {ER}+ group into four subgroups, two of them being highly proliferative. Of the six subgroups, four were {ER}+/{PR}+/{AR}+, one was {ER}-/{PR}-/{AR}+ and one was triple negative ({AR}-/{ER}-/{PR}-). {ERBB}2-amplified tumors were split between the {ER}-/{PR}-/{AR}+ subgroup and the highly proliferative {ER}+ {LumC} subgroup. Importantly, each of these six molecular subgroups showed specific copy-number alterations. Gene expression changes were correlated to specific signaling pathways. Each of these six subgroups showed very significant differences in tumor grade, metastatic sites, relapse-free survival or response to chemotherapy. All these findings were validated on large external datasets including more than 3000 tumors. Our data thus indicate that these six molecular subgroups represent well-defined clinico-biological entities of breast cancer. Their identification should facilitate the detection of novel prognostic factors or therapeutical targets in breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}
Previous research identified differences in breast cancer-specific mortality across 4 intrinsic tumor subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive/estrogen receptor negative ({HER}2(+)/{ER}(-)).

{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}
We used immunohistochemical markers to subtype 1,149 invasive breast cancer patients (518 African American, 631 white) in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, a population-based study of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Vital status was determined through 2006 using the National Death Index, with median follow-up of 9 years.

{RESULTS}
Cancer subtypes luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, and {HER}2(+)/{ER}(-) were distributed as 64\%, 11\%, 11\%, and 5\% for whites, and 48\%, 8\%, 22\%, and 7\% for African Americans, respectively. Breast cancer mortality was higher for participants with {HER}2(+)/{ER}(-) and basal-like breast cancer compared with luminal A and B. African Americans had higher breast cancer-specific mortality than whites, but the effect of race was statistically significant only among women with luminal A breast cancer. However, when compared with the luminal A subtype within racial categories, mortality for participants with basal-like breast cancer was higher among whites ({HR} = 2.0, 95\% {CI}: 1.2-3.4) than African Americans ({HR} = 1.5, 95\% {CI}: 1.0-2.4), with the strongest effect seen in postmenopausal white women ({HR} = 3.9, 95\% {CI}: 1.5-10.0).

{CONCLUSIONS}
Our results confirm the association of basal-like breast cancer with poor prognosis and suggest that basal-like breast cancer is not an inherently more aggressive disease in African American women compared with whites. Additional analyses are needed in populations with known treatment profiles to understand the role of tumor subtypes and race in breast cancer mortality, and in particular our finding that among women with luminal A breast cancer, African Americans have higher mortality than whites.},

	abstract = {In genome-enabled prediction, parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric regression models have been used. This study assessed the predictive ability of linear and non-linear models using dense molecular markers. The linear models were linear on marker effects and included the Bayesian {LASSO}, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B. The non-linear models (this refers to non-linearity on markers) were reproducing kernel Hilbert space ({RKHS}) regression, Bayesian regularized neural networks ({BRNN}), and radial basis function neural networks ({RBFNN}). These statistical models were compared using 306 elite wheat lines from {CIMMYT} genotyped with 1717 diversity array technology ({DArT}) markers and two traits, days to heading ({DTH}) and grain yield ({GY}), measured in each of 12 environments. It was found that the three non-linear models had better overall prediction accuracy than the linear regression specification. Results showed a consistent superiority of {RKHS} and {RBFNN} over the Bayesian {LASSO}, Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, and Bayes B models.},

	abstract = {In recent work, several authors have introduced methods for sparse canonical correlation analysis (sparse {CCA}). Suppose that two sets of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse {CCA} is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other. It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse {CCA} methodology. (1) Sparse {CCA} is an unsupervised method; that is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We propose an extension to sparse {CCA}, which we call sparse supervised {CCA}, which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on the same set of samples; for instance, {SNP}, gene expression, and {DNA} copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse multiple {CCA} in order to extend the sparse {CCA} methodology to the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Triple-negative cancer constitutes one of the most challenging groups of breast cancer given its aggressive clinical behaviour, poor outcome and lack of targeted therapy. Until now, profiling techniques have not been able to distinguish between patients with a good and poor outcome. Recent studies on tumour-stroma, found it to play an important role in tumour growth and progression.
{OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate the prognostic value of the tumour-stroma ratio ({TSR}) in triple-negative breast cancer.
{METHODS}: One hundred twenty four consecutive triple-negative breast cancer patients treated in our hospital were selected and evaluated. For each patient the Haematoxylin-Eosin (H\&E) stained histological sections were evaluated for percentage of stroma. Patients with less than 50\% stroma were classified as stroma-low and patients with ≥ 50\% stroma were classified as stroma-high.
{RESULTS}: Of 124 triple-negative breast cancer patients, 40\% had a stroma-high and 60\% had a stroma-low tumour. {TSR} was assessed by two investigators (kappa 0.74). The 5-years relapse-free period ({RFP}) and overall survival ({OS}) were 85\% and 89\% in the stroma-low and 45\% and 65\% in the stroma-high group. In a multivariate cox-regression analysis, stroma amount remained an independent prognostic variable for {RFP} ({HR} 2.39; 95\% {CI} 1.07-5.29; p = 0.033) and {OS} ({HR} 3.00; 95\% {CI} 1.08-8.32; 0.034).
{CONCLUSION}: {TSR} is a strong independent prognostic variable in triple-negative breast cancer. It is simple to determine, reproducible and can be easily incorporated into routine histological examination. This parameter can help optimize risk stratification and might lead to future targeted therapies.},

	shorttitle = {Distinct distribution and prognostic significance of molecular subtypes of breast cancer in Chinese women},
	abstract = {Background
Molecular classification of breast cancer is an important prognostic factor. The distribution of molecular subtypes of breast cancer and their prognostic value has not been well documented in Asians.

Methods
A total of 2,791 breast cancer patients recruited for a population-based cohort study were evaluated for molecular subtypes of breast cancer by immunohistochemical assays. Data on clinicopathological characteristics were confirmed by centralized pathology review. The average follow-up of the patients was 53.4 months. Overall and disease-free survival by molecular subtypes of breast cancer were evaluated.

Results
The prevalence of the luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2), and triple-negative subtypes were 48.6\%, 16.7\%, 13.7\%, and 12.9\%, respectively. The luminal A subtype was more likely to be diagnosed in older women (P = 0.03) and had a stronger correlation with favorable clinicopathological factors (smaller tumor size, lower histologic grade, and earlier {TNM} stage) than the triple-negative or {HER}2 subtypes. Women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher frequency of family history of breast cancer than women with other subtypes (P = 0.048). The 5-year overall/disease-free survival percentages for the luminal A, luminal B, {HER}2, and triple-negative subtypes were 92.9\%/88.6\%, 88.6\%/85.1\%, 83.2\%/79.1\%, and 80.7\%/76.0\%, respectively. A similar pattern was observed in multivariate analyses. Immunotherapy was associated with improved overall and disease-free survival for luminal A breast cancer, but reduced disease-free survival ({HR} = 2.21, 95\% {CI}, 1.09-4.48) for the {HER}2 subtype of breast cancer.

Conclusions
The triple-negative and {HER}2 subtypes were associated with poorer outcomes compared with the luminal A subtype among these Chinese women. The {HER}2 subtype was more prevalent in this Chinese population compared with Western populations, suggesting the importance of standardized {HER}2 detection and anti-{HER}2 therapy to potentially benefit a high proportion of breast cancer patients in China.},

To discover the {microRNAs} regulating this critical transition, we used 80 biopsies from invasive ductal carcinoma, 8 from ductal carcinoma in situ, and 6 from normal breast. We selected them from a recently published deep-sequencing dataset [Farazi {TA}, et al. (2011) Cancer Res 71:4443–4453]. The {microRNA} profile established for the normal breast to ductal carcinoma in situ transition was largely maintained in the in situ to invasive ductal carcinoma transition. Nevertheless, a nine-{microRNA} signature was identified that differentiated invasive from in situ carcinoma. Specifically, let-7d, {miR}-210, and -221 were down-regulated in the in situ and up-regulated in the invasive transition, thus featuring an expression reversal along the cancer progression path. Additionally, we identified {microRNAs} for overall survival and time to metastasis. Five noncoding genes were associated with both prognostic signatures—{miR}-210, -21, -106b*, -197, and let-7i, with {miR}-210 the only one also involved in the invasive transition. To pinpoint critical cellular functions affected in the invasive transition, we identified the protein coding genes with inversely related profiles to {miR}-210: {BRCA}1, {FANCD}, {FANCF}, {PARP}1, E-cadherin, and Rb1 were all activated in the in situ and down-regulated in the invasive carcinoma. Additionally, we detected differential splicing isoforms with special features, including a truncated {EGFR} lacking the kinase domain and overexpressed only in ductal carcinoma in situ.},

	abstract = {Human breast cancers are broadly classified based on their gene-expression profiles into luminal- and basal-type tumors. These two major tumor subtypes express markers corresponding to the major differentiation states of epithelial cells in the breast: luminal ({EpCAM}+) and basal/myoepithelial ({CD}10+). However, there are also rare types of breast cancers, such as metaplastic carcinomas, where tumor cells exhibit features of alternate cell types that no longer resemble breast epithelium. Until now, it has been difficult to identify the cell type(s) in the human breast that gives rise to these various forms of breast cancer. Here we report that transformation of {EpCAM}+ epithelial cells results in the formation of common forms of human breast cancer, including estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative tumors with luminal and basal-like characteristics, respectively, whereas transformation of {CD}10+ cells results in the development of rare metaplastic tumors reminiscent of the claudin-low subtype. We also demonstrate the existence of {CD}10+ breast cells with metaplastic traits that can give rise to skin and epidermal tissues. Furthermore, we show that the development of metaplastic breast cancer is attributable, in part, to the transformation of these metaplastic breast epithelial cells. These findings identify normal cellular precursors to human breast cancers and reveal the existence of a population of cells with epidermal progenitor activity within adult human breast tissues.},

This hypothesis places emphasis on the {FT} secretory epithelial cell as a cell-of-origin. Herein, we report the development of a novel ex vivo primary human {FT} epithelium culture system that faithfully recapitulates the in vivo epithelium, as shown by morphological, ultrastructural and immunophenotypic analyses. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics reveal that these cultures secrete proteins previously identified as biomarkers for ovarian cancer. We also use this culture system to study the response of the {FT} epithelium to genotoxic stress and find that the secretory cells exhibit a distinct response to {DNA} damage when compared with neighboring ciliated cells. The secretory cells show a limited ability to resolve the damage over time, potentially leaving them more susceptible to accumulation of additional mutagenic injury. This divergent response is confirmed with in situ studies using tissue samples, further supporting the use of this ex vivo culture system to investigate {FT} epithelial pathobiology. We anticipate that this novel culture system will facilitate the study of {SOC} pathogenesis, and propose that similar culture systems could be developed for other organ site-specific epithelia.},

Although much remains to be learned about the second phase, we feel that an understanding of the first phase is now within sight, due in part to a better understanding of how cancer cell behavior can be modified by a cell-biological program called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) are implicated in osteosarcoma biology and chemoresponse, {miRNA} prognostic models are still needed, particularly because prognosis is imperfectly correlated with chemoresponse. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is a necessary resource for biomarker studies in this malignancy with limited frozen tissue availability. {METHODS}: We performed {miRNA} and {mRNA} microarray formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded assays in 65 osteosarcoma biopsy and 26 paired post-chemotherapy resection specimens and used the only publicly available {miRNA} dataset, generated independently by another group, to externally validate our strongest findings (n = 29). We used supervised principal components analysis and logistic regression for survival and chemoresponse, and {miRNA} activity and target gene set analysis to study {miRNA} regulatory activity. {RESULTS}: Several {miRNA}-based models with as few as five {miRNAs} were prognostic independently of pathologically assessed chemoresponse (median recurrence-free survival: 59 months versus not-yet-reached; adjusted hazards ratio = 2.90; P = 0.036). The independent dataset supported the reproducibility of recurrence and survival findings. The prognostic value of the profile was independent of confounding by known prognostic variables, including chemoresponse, tumor location and metastasis at diagnosis. Model performance improved when chemoresponse was added as a covariate (median recurrence-free survival: 59 months versus not-yet-reached; hazard ratio = 3.91; P = 0.002). Most prognostic {miRNAs} were located at 14q32 - a locus already linked to osteosarcoma - and their gene targets display deregulation patterns associated with outcome. We also identified {miRNA} profiles predictive of chemoresponse (75\% to 80\% accuracy), which did not overlap with prognostic profiles. {CONCLUSIONS}: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue-derived {miRNA} patterns are a powerful prognostic tool for risk-stratified osteosarcoma management strategies. Combined {miRNA} and {mRNA} analysis supports a possible role of the 14q32 locus in osteosarcoma progression and outcome. Our study creates a paradigm for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded-based {miRNA} biomarker studies in cancer.},

	abstract = {{RNA}-seq, a next-generation sequencing based method for transcriptome analysis, is rapidly emerging as the method of choice for comprehensive transcript abundance estimation. The accuracy of {RNA}-seq can be highly impacted by the purity of samples. A prominent, outstanding problem in {RNA}-seq is how to estimate transcript abundances in heterogeneous tissues, where a sample is composed of more than one cell type and the inhomogeneity can substantially confound the transcript abundance estimation of each individual cell type. Although experimental methods have been proposed to dissect multiple distinct cell types, computationally "deconvoluting" heterogeneous tissues provides an attractive alternative, since it keeps the tissue sample as well as the subsequent molecular content yield intact.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Gene expression signatures have been identified for epithelial ovarian cancer survival ({TCGA}) and intrinsic subtypes (Tothill et al.). One obstacle to clinical translation is that these signatures were developed using frozen tissue, whereas usually only formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded ({FFPE}) tissue is available. The aim of this study was to determine if gene expression signatures can be translated to fixed archival tissues.
{METHODS}: {RNA} extracted from {FFPE} sections from 240 primary ovarian cancers was analyzed by {DASL} on Illumina {BeadChip} arrays. Concordance of expression at the individual gene level was assessed by comparing array data from the same cancers (30 frozen samples analyzed on Affymetrix arrays versus {FFPE} {DASL}).
{RESULTS}: The correlation between {FFPE} and frozen survival signature estimates was 0.774. The {TCGA} signature using {DASL} was predictive of survival in 106 advanced stage high grade serous ovarian cancers (median survival 33 versus 60 months, estimated hazard ratio for death 2.30, P=0.0007). Similar to Tothill, we found using {DASL} that most high grade serous ovarian cancers (102/110, 93\%) were assigned to subtypes 1, 2, 4 and 5, whereas most endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous and low grade serous cases (39/57, 68\%) were assigned to subtypes 3 and 6 (P{\textless}10e-15).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although individual probe estimates of microarrays may be weakly correlated between {FFPE} and frozen samples, combinations of probes have robust ability to predict survival and subtype. This suggests that it may be possible to use these signatures for prognostic and predictive purposes as we seek to individualize the treatment of ovarian cancer.},

Although both men and women can get fat, they get fat in different ways, and suffer different consequences. We review differences between men and women in the incidence of obesity, fat deposition patterns, fat metabolism, and the health consequences of obesity, and examine potential evolutionary explanations for these differences. Women generally have a larger proportion of body mass as fat, and are more likely to deposit fat subcutaneously and on their lower extremities; men are more likely to deposit fat in the abdominal region. Excess adipose tissue in the abdominal region, especially visceral fat, is associated with more health risks. Women have higher rates of reuptake of {NEFA} into adipose tissue; however, they also have higher rates of fat oxidation during prolonged exercise. Oestrogen appears to underlie many of these differences. Women bear higher nutrient costs during reproduction. Fat and fertility are linked in women, through leptin. Low leptin levels reduce fertility. Ovarian function of adult women is associated with their fatness at birth. In our evolutionary past food insecurity was a frequent occurrence. Women would have benefited from an increased ability to store fat in easily metabolisable depots. We suggest that the pattern of central obesity, more commonly seen in men, is not adaptive, but rather reflects the genetic drift hypothesis of human susceptibility to obesity. Female obesity, with excess adiposity in the lower extremities, reflects an exaggeration of an adaptation for female reproductive success.},

Though the ovarian surface epithelium is thought to provide the primary site of tumorigenesis, the exact etiology of the various tumor types associated with this disease remain undefined. Recent evidence suggests that ovarian tumors, like other solid tumors, contain distinct populations of cells that are responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance and growth. These specialized cells, termed cancer stem cells, display some of the hallmarks of normal stem cells and are thought to evade current chemotherapeutic strategies, resulting in an increased risk of recurrence. Here we review evidence for the existence of cancer stem cells in ovarian malignancies and their contribution to the pathology of this disease, critically evaluate the methods used for ovarian cancer stem cell definition and isolation, and discuss their clinical relevance.},

Conversely, another subset of {miRNAs} controls the expression of important epigenetic regulators, including {DNA} methyltransferases, histone deacetylases and polycomb group genes. This complicated network of feedback between {miRNAs} and epigenetic pathways appears to form an epigenetics-{miRNA} regulatory circuit, and to organize the whole gene expression profile.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Current network-based microarray analysis uses the information of interactions among concerned genes/gene products, but still considers each gene expression individually. We propose an organized knowledge-supervised approach - Integrative {eXpression} Profiling ({IXP}), to improve microarray classification accuracy, and help discover groups of genes that have been too weak to detect individually by traditional ways. To implement {IXP}, ant colony optimization reordering ({ACOR}) algorithm is used to group functionally related genes in an ordered way.
{RESULTS}: Using Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) as an example, we demonstrate how to apply {ACOR}-based {IXP} approach into microarray classifications. Using a microarray dataset - {GSE}1297 with 31 samples as training set, the result for the blinded classification on another microarray dataset - {GSE}5281 with 151 samples, shows that our approach can improve accuracy from 74.83\% to 82.78\%. A recently-published 1372-probe signature for {AD} can only achieve 61.59\% accuracy in the same condition. The {ACOR}-based {IXP} approach also has better performance than the {IXP} approach based on classic network ranking, graph clustering, and random-ordering methods in an overall classification performance comparison.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {ACOR}-based {IXP} approach can serve as a knowledge-supervised feature transformation approach to increase classification accuracy dramatically, by transforming each gene expression profile to an integrated expression files as features inputting into standard classifiers. The {IXP} approach integrates both gene expression information and organized knowledge - disease gene/protein network topology information, which is represented as both network node weights (local topological properties) and network node orders (global topological characteristics).},

	abstract = {Motivation: The use of {DNA} microarrays has become quite popular in many scientific and medical disciplines, such as in cancer research. One common goal of these studies is to determine which genes are differentially expressed between cancer and healthy tissue, or more generally, between two experimental conditions. A major complication in the molecular profiling of tumors using gene expression data is that the data represent a combination of tumor and normal cells. Much of the methodology developed for assessing differential expression with microarray data has assumed that tissue samples are homogeneous.Results: In this paper, we outline a general framework for determining differential expression in the presence of mixed cell populations. We consider study designs in which paired tissues and unpaired tissues are available. A hierarchical mixture model is used for modeling the data; a combination of methods of moments procedures and the expectation–maximization algorithm are used to estimate the model parameters. The finite-sample properties of the methods are assessed in simulation studies; they are applied to two microarray datasets from cancer studies.

	abstract = {There is a increasing interest in analysis of large-scale multiway data. The concept of multiway data refers to arrays of data with more than two dimensions, that is, taking the form of tensors. To analyze such data, decomposition techniques are widely used. The two most common decompositions for tensors are the Tucker model and the more restricted {PARAFAC} model. Both models can be viewed as generalizations of the regular factor analysis to data of more than two modalities. Nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}), in conjunction with sparse coding, has recently been given much attention due to its part-based and easy interpretable representation. While {NMF} has been extended to the {PARAFAC} model, no such attempt has been done to extend {NMF} to the Tucker model. However, if the tensor data analyzed are nonnegative, it may well be relevant to consider purely additive (i.e., nonnegative) Tucker decompositions). To reduce ambiguities of this type of decomposition, we develop updates that can impose sparseness in any combination of modalities, hence, proposed algorithms for sparse nonnegative Tucker decompositions ({SN}-{TUCKER}). We demonstrate how the proposed algorithms are superior to existing algorithms for Tucker decompositions when the data and interactions can be considered nonnegative. We further illustrate how sparse coding can help identify what model ({PARAFAC} or Tucker) is more appropriate for the data as well as to select the number of components by turning off excess components. The algorithms for {SN}-{TUCKER} can be downloaded from Mørup (2007).},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}
Multiple breast cancer gene expression profiles have been developed that appear to provide similar abilities to predict outcome and may outperform clinical-pathologic criteria; however, the extent to which seemingly disparate profiles provide additive prognostic information is not known, nor do we know whether prognostic profiles perform equally across clinically defined breast cancer subtypes. We evaluated whether combining the prognostic powers of standard breast cancer clinical variables with a large set of gene expression signatures could improve on our ability to predict patient outcomes.

{METHODS}
Using clinical-pathological variables and a collection of 323 gene expression "modules", including 115 previously published signatures, we build multivariate Cox proportional hazards models using a dataset of 550 node-negative systemically untreated breast cancer patients. Models predictive of pathological complete response ({pCR}) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were also built using this approach.

{RESULTS}
We identified statistically significant prognostic models for relapse-free survival ({RFS}) at 7 years for the entire population, and for the subgroups of patients with {ER}-positive, or Luminal tumors. Furthermore, we found that combined models that included both clinical and genomic parameters improved prognostication compared with models with either clinical or genomic variables alone. Finally, we were able to build statistically significant combined models for pathological complete response ({pCR}) predictions for the entire population.

{CONCLUSIONS}
Integration of gene expression signatures and clinical-pathological factors is an improved method over either variable type alone. Highly prognostic models could be created when using all patients, and for the subset of patients with lymph node-negative and {ER}-positive breast cancers. Other variables beyond gene expression and clinical-pathological variables, like gene mutation status or {DNA} copy number changes, will be needed to build robust prognostic models for {ER}-negative breast cancer patients. This combined clinical and genomics model approach can also be used to build predictors of therapy responsiveness, and could ultimately be applied to other tumor types.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Gene set analysis ({GSA}) is a widely used strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge. {GSA} focuses on sets of related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological relevance. However, previous {GSA} methods have limited usage as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs.


{RESULTS}

To address these limitations, we present a new {GSA} method called Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment ({GAGE}). We successfully apply {GAGE} to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques. {GAGE} shows significantly better results when compared to two other commonly used {GSA} methods of {GSEA} and {PAGE}. We demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3) biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred.{GAGE} reveals novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data sets, {GAGE} derived a more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished {BMP}6 study, {GAGE} predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for {BMP}6 induced osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical {BMP}-{TGF} beta signaling, {JAK}-{STAT} signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways-all of which are supported by the experimental literature.


{CONCLUSION}

{GAGE} is generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes and experimental designs. {GAGE} consistently outperformed two most frequently used {GSA} methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant regulatory pathways. The {GAGE} method is implemented in R in the "gage" package, available under the {GNU} {GPL} from http://sysbio.engin.umich.edu/{\textasciitilde}luow/downloads.php.},

	abstract = {Human tumours typically harbour a remarkable number of somatic mutations. If presented on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules ({MHCI}), peptides containing these mutations could potentially be immunogenic as they should be recognized as /`non-self/' neo-antigens by the adaptive immune system. Recent work has confirmed that mutant peptides can serve as T-cell epitopes. However, few mutant epitopes have been described because their discovery required the laborious screening of patient tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes for their ability to recognize antigen libraries constructed following tumour exome sequencing. We sought to simplify the discovery of immunogenic mutant peptides by characterizing their general properties. We developed an approach that combines whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing analysis with mass spectrometry to identify neo-epitopes in two widely used murine tumour models. Of the {\textgreater}1,300 amino acid changes identified, [sim]13\% were predicted to bind {MHCI}, a small fraction of which were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The peptides were then structurally modelled bound to {MHCI}. Mutations that were solvent-exposed and therefore accessible to T-cell antigen receptors were predicted to be immunogenic. Vaccination of mice confirmed the approach, with each predicted immunogenic peptide yielding therapeutically active T-cell responses. The predictions also enabled the generation of peptide-{MHCI} dextramers that could be used to monitor the kinetics and distribution of the anti-tumour T-cell response before and after vaccination. These findings indicate that a suitable prediction algorithm may provide an approach for the pharmacodynamic monitoring of T-cell responses as well as for the development of personalized vaccines in cancer patients.},

Next, using a dataset of {\textgreater}1,000 human breast tumor gene expression microarrays we determined that {HER}2-enriched subtype tumors aggressively spread to the liver, while basal-like and claudin-low subtypes colonize the brain and lung.

Interestingly, low "Differentiation Scores," or high expression of the aforementioned signatures, further predicted for brain and lung metastases.

	abstract = {Background Single sample predictors ({SSPs}) and Subtype classification models ({SCMs}) are gene expression–based classifiers used to identify the four primary molecular subtypes of breast cancer (basal-like, {HER}2-enriched, luminal A, and luminal B). {SSPs} use hierarchical clustering, followed by nearest centroid classification, based on large sets of tumor-intrinsic genes. {SCMs} use a mixture of Gaussian distributions based on sets of genes with expression specifically correlated with three key breast cancer genes (estrogen receptor [{ER}], {HER}2, and aurora kinase A [{AURKA}]). The aim of this study was to compare the robustness, classification concordance, and prognostic value of these classifiers with those of a simplified three-gene {SCM} in a large compendium of microarray datasets.
Methods Thirty-six publicly available breast cancer datasets (n = 5715) were subjected to molecular subtyping using five published classifiers (three {SSPs} and two {SCMs}) and {SCMGENE}, the new three-gene ({ER}, {HER}2, and {AURKA}) {SCM}. We used the prediction strength statistic to estimate robustness of the classification models, defined as the capacity of a classifier to assign the same tumors to the same subtypes independently of the dataset used to fit it. We used Cohen κ and Cramer V coefficients to assess concordance between the subtype classifiers and association with clinical variables, respectively. We used Kaplan–Meier survival curves and cross-validated partial likelihood to compare prognostic value of the resulting classifications. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results {SCMs} were statistically significantly more robust than {SSPs}, with {SCMGENE} being the most robust because of its simplicity. {SCMGENE} was statistically significantly concordant with published {SCMs} (κ = 0.65–0.70) and {SSPs} (κ = 0.34–0.59), statistically significantly associated with {ER} (V = 0.64), {HER}2 (V = 0.52) status, and histological grade (V = 0.55), and yielded similar strong prognostic value.
Conclusion Our results suggest that adequate classification of the major and clinically relevant molecular subtypes of breast cancer can be robustly achieved with quantitative measurements of three key genes.},

Such data provide unique opportunities to study the coordination between regulatory mechanisms on multiple levels. However, integrative analysis of multi-dimensional genomics data for the discovery of combinatorial patterns is currently lacking. Here, we adopt a joint matrix factorization technique to address this challenge. This method projects multiple types of genomic data onto a common coordinate system, in which heterogeneous variables weighted highly in the same projected direction form a multi-dimensional module (md-module). Genomic variables in such modules are characterized by significant correlations and likely functional associations. We applied this method to the {DM}, {GE}, and {microRNA} expression data of 385 ovarian cancer samples from the The Cancer Genome Atlas project. These md-modules revealed perturbed pathways that would have been overlooked with only a single type of data, uncovered associations between different layers of cellular activities and allowed the identification of clinically distinct patient subgroups. Our study provides an useful protocol for uncovering hidden patterns and their biological implications in multi-dimensional ‘omic’ data.},

For instance, these regulatory subunits are necessary to recapitulate in vivo ion currents and to further understand the physiological role of ion channels. {KCNEs} are a family of regulatory subunits that interact with a wide range of channels. We have described for the first time a molecular interaction between {KCNE}4 and the voltage-dependent potassium channel {KV}1.3. The association of {KCNE}4, which alters the biophysical properties, trafficking and membrane localization of {KV}1.3, functions as an endogenous dominantnegative mechanism. Since both proteins are expressed in the immune system, {KV}1.3/{KCNE}4 channels may contribute to the fine-tuning of the immune response. Therefore, our results point to {KCNE}4 as a novel target for immunomodulation. {KCNE}4 is not the only {KCNE} which is expressed in leukocytes. All {KCNEs} ({KCNE}1-5) are present, and some members demonstrate modulation during proliferation and cancer. In summary, regulatory {KCNE} subunits are expressed in the immune system. In addition, several voltage-dependent K+ channels, which could interact with {KCNEs}, are also detected.

	abstract = {Intratumoral heterogeneity challenges existing paradigms for anti-cancer therapy. We have previously demonstrated that the human embryonic stem cells ({hESC})-derived cellular microenvironment in immunocompromised mice, enables functional distinction of heterogeneous tumor cells, including cells which do not grow into a tumor in conventional direct tumor xenograft platform. We have identified and characterized six cancer cell subpopulations each clonally expanded from a single cell, derived from human ovarian clear cell carcinoma of a single tumor, to demonstrate striking intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity that is dynamically dependent on the tumor growth microenvironment. These cancer cell subpopulations, characterized as cancer stem cell subpopulations, faithfully recapitulate the full spectrum of histological phenotypic heterogeneity known for human ovarian clear cell carcinoma. Each of the six subpopulations displays a different level of morphologic and tumorigenic differentiation wherein growth in the {hESC}-derived microenvironment favors growth of {CD}44+/aldehyde dehydrogenase positive pockets of self-renewing cells that sustain tumor growth through a process of tumorigenic differentiation into {CD}44-/aldehyde dehydrogenase negative derivatives. Strikingly, these derivative cells display microenvironment-dependent plasticity with the capacity to restore self-renewal markers and {CD}44 expression. We delineated the distinct gene expression and epigenetic profiles of two such subpopulations, representing extremes of phenotypic heterogeneity in terms of niche-dependent self-renewal and tumorigenic differentiation. By combining Gene Set Enrichment, Gene Ontology and Pathway-focused array analyses with methylation status and secretome analyses, we propose a suite of robust differences in tumor self-renewal and differentiation pathways, and interaction with stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment that underlay the striking intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity which characterized this and other solid tumor malignancies.

	abstract = {All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the {DNA} damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with {BRCA}1 or {BRCA}2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed "kataegis," was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at {TpC} dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the {APOBEC} family of cytidine deaminases is proposed. {PAPERCLIP}:},

	abstract = {Introduction
Global gene expression analysis of tumor samples has been a valuable tool to subgroup tumors and has the potential to be of prognostic and predictive value. However, tumors are heterogeneous, and homogenates will consist of several different cell types. This study was designed to obtain more refined expression data representing different compartments of the tumor.

Methods
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded stroma-rich triple-negative breast cancer tumors were laser-microdissected, and {RNA} was extracted and processed to enable microarray hybridization. Genes enriched in stroma were identified and used to generate signatures by identifying correlating genes in publicly available data sets. The prognostic implications of the signature were analyzed.

Results
Comparison of the expression pattern from stromal and cancer cell compartments from three tumors revealed a number of genes that were essentially specifically expressed in the respective compartments. The stroma-specific genes indicated contribution from fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune/inflammatory cells. The gene set was expanded by identifying correlating {mRNAs} using breast cancer {mRNA} expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. By iterative analyses, 16 gene signatures of highly correlating genes were characterized. Based on the gene composition, they seem to represent different cell types. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, two immune/inflammatory signatures had opposing hazard ratios for breast cancer recurrence also after adjusting for clinicopathological variables and molecular subgroup. The signature associated with poor prognosis consisted mainly of C1Q genes and the one associated with good prognosis contained {HLA} genes. This association with prognosis was seen for other cancers as well as in other breast cancer data sets.

Conclusions
Our data indicate that the molecular composition of the immune response in a tumor may be a powerful predictor of cancer prognosis.

	abstract = {Nuclear export of {mRNA} is a central step in gene expression that shows extensive coupling to transcription and transcript processing. However, little is known about the fate of {mRNA} and its export under conditions that damage the {DNA} template and {RNA} itself. Here we report the discovery of four new factors required for {mRNA} export through a screen of all annotated nonessential Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. Two of these factors, {mRNA} surveillance factor Rrp6 and {DNA} repair protein Lrp1, are nuclear exosome components that physically interact with one another. We find that Lrp1 mediates specific {mRNA} degradation upon {DNA}-damaging {UV} irradiation as well as general {mRNA} degradation. Lrp1 requires Rrp6 for genomic localization to genes encoding its {mRNA} targets, and Rrp6 genomic localization in turn correlates with transcription. Further, Rrp6 and Lrp1 are both required for repair of {UV}-induced {DNA} damage. These results demonstrate coupling of {mRNA} surveillance to {mRNA} export and suggest specificity of the {RNA} surveillance machinery for different transcript populations. Broadly, these findings link {DNA} and {RNA} surveillance to {mRNA} export.},

Combining existing methods such as co-inertia analysis, back-transformation, Hungarian matching and majority voting in an iterative non-greedy hill-climbing approach, it affiliates arrays and genes at the same time, maximizing the co-structure between the datasets. To introduce the method, we demonstrate its performance on two closely and two distantly related datasets of different experimental context and produced on different platforms. Each pair stems from two different species. The resulting cross-species dynamic Bayesian gene networks improve on the networks inferred from each dataset alone by yielding more significant network motifs, as well as more of the interactions already recorded in {KEGG} and other databases. Also, it is shown that our algorithm converges on the optimal number of nodes for network inference. Being readily extendable to more than two datasets, it provides the opportunity to infer extensive gene regulatory networks.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Advanced prostate cancer is treated by hormone ablation therapy. However, despite an initial response, the majority of men relapse to develop castration-resistant disease for which there are no effective treatments. We have previously shown that manipulating individual proteins has only minor alterations on the resistant phenotype so we hypothesize that targeting the central transcription factors ({TFs}) would represent a better therapeutic approach.
{METHODS}: We have undertaken a transcriptomic analysis of gene expression differences between the androgen-dependent {LNCaP} parental cells and its castration-resistant Abl and Hof sublines, revealing 1,660 genes associated with castration-resistance. Using effective bioinformatic techniques, these transcriptomic data were integrated with {TF} binding sites resulting in a list of {TFs} associated with the differential gene expression observed.
{RESULTS}: Following validation of the gene-chip results, the serum response factor ({SRF}) was chosen for clinical validation and functional analysis due to its recent association with prostate cancer progression. {SRF} immunoreactivity in prostate tumor samples was shown for the first time to be associated with castration-resistance. {SRF} inhibition by {siRNA} and the small molecule inhibitor {CCG}-1423 resulted in decreased proliferation.

Recently, we found that the key features of reperfusion injury, namely loss of {ATP}/{NADH}, increased oxidative stress and cell death were underpinned by proteomic deficiencies in ischemic/reperfused myocardium, and could be ameliorated by proteins in exosomes. To test this hypothesis in vivo, mice (C57Bl6/J) underwent 30 min ischemia, followed by reperfusion (I/R injury). Purified exosomes or saline was administered 5 min before reperfusion. Exosomes reduced infarct size by 45\% compared to saline treatment. Langendorff experiments revealed that intact but not lysed exosomes enhanced viability of the ischemic/reperfused myocardium. Exosome treated animals exhibited significant preservation of left ventricular geometry and contractile performance during 28 days follow-up. Within an hour after reperfusion, exosome treatment increased levels of {ATP} and {NADH}, decreased oxidative stress, increased phosphorylated-Akt and phosphorylated-{GSK}-3β, and reduced phosphorylated-c-{JNK} in ischemic/reperfused hearts. Subsequently, both local and systemic inflammation were significantly reduced 24h after reperfusion. In conclusion, our study shows that intact exosomes restore bioenergetics, reduce oxidative stress and activate pro-survival signaling, thereby enhancing cardiac function and geometry after myocardial I/R injury. Hence, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes are a potential adjuvant to reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction.},

By retrieving {\textgreater}2,000 known disease genes, and generating 1,500 disease-associated protein complexes, we analyzed the differential expression of a gene or complex involved in a particular disease in the tissues affected by the disease, compared with nonaffected tissues. When this analysis is scaled to all diseases in our dataset, there is a significant tendency for disease genes and complexes to be overexpressed in the normal tissues where defects cause pathology. In contrast, cancer genes and complexes were not overexpressed in the tissues from which the tumors emanate. We specifically identified a complex involved in {XY} sex reversal that is testis-specific and down-regulated in ovaries. We also identified complexes in Parkinson disease, cardiomyopathies, and muscular dystrophy syndromes that are similarly tissue specific. Our method represents a conceptual scaffold for organism-spanning analyses and reveals an extensive list of tissue-specific draft molecular pathways, both known and unexpected, that might be disrupted in disease.},

Recent genome-wide association studies of breast cancer have identified eight additional breast cancer susceptibility loci: rs1011970 (9p21, {CDKN}2A/B), rs10995190 ({ZNF}365), rs704010 ({ZMIZ}1), rs2380205 (10p15), rs614367 (11q13), rs1292011 (12q24), rs10771399 (12p11 near {PTHLH}) and rs865686 (9q31.2).
{METHODS}: To evaluate whether these single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) are associated with breast cancer risk for {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 carriers, we genotyped these {SNPs} in 12,599 {BRCA}1 and 7,132 {BRCA}2 mutation carriers and analysed the associations with breast cancer risk within a retrospective likelihood framework.
{RESULTS}: Only {SNP} rs10771399 near {PTHLH} was associated with breast cancer risk for {BRCA}1 mutation carriers (per-allele hazard ratio ({HR}) = 0.87, 95\% {CI}: 0.81 to 0.94, P-trend = 3 × 10-4). The association was restricted to mutations proven or predicted to lead to absence of protein expression ({HR} = 0.82, 95\% {CI}: 0.74 to 0.90, P-trend = 3.1 × 10-5, P-difference = 0.03). Four {SNPs} were associated with the risk of breast cancer for {BRCA}2 mutation carriers: rs10995190, P-trend = 0.015; rs1011970, P-trend = 0.048; rs865686, 2df-P = 0.007; rs1292011 2df-P = 0.03. rs10771399 ({PTHLH}) was predominantly associated with estrogen receptor ({ER})-negative breast cancer for {BRCA}1 mutation carriers ({HR} = 0.81, 95\% {CI}: 0.74 to 0.90, P-trend = 4 × 10-5) and there was marginal evidence of association with {ER}-negative breast cancer for {BRCA}2 mutation carriers ({HR} = 0.78, 95\% {CI}: 0.62 to 1.00, P-trend = 0.049).
{CONCLUSIONS}: The present findings, in combination with previously identified modifiers of risk, will ultimately lead to more accurate risk prediction and an improved understanding of the disease etiology in {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 mutation carriers.},

	abstract = {The cellular composition of heterogeneous samples can be predicted using an expression deconvolution algorithm to decompose their gene expression profiles based on pre-defined, reference gene expression profiles of the constituent populations in these samples. However, the expression profiles of the actual constituent populations are often perturbed from those of the reference profiles due to gene expression changes in cells associated with microenvironmental or developmental effects. Existing deconvolution algorithms do not account for these changes and give incorrect results when benchmarked against those measured by well-established flow cytometry, even after batch correction was applied. We introduce {PERT}, a new probabilistic expression deconvolution method that detects and accounts for a shared, multiplicative perturbation in the reference profiles when performing expression deconvolution. We applied {PERT} and three other state-of-the-art expression deconvolution methods to predict cell frequencies within heterogeneous human blood samples that were collected under several conditions (uncultured mono-nucleated and lineage-depleted cells, and culture-derived lineage-depleted cells). Only {PERT}'s predicted proportions of the constituent populations matched those assigned by flow cytometry. Genes associated with cell cycle processes were highly enriched among those with the largest predicted expression changes between the cultured and uncultured conditions. We anticipate that {PERT} will be widely applicable to expression deconvolution strategies that use profiles from reference populations that vary from the corresponding constituent populations in cellular state but not cellular phenotypic identity.},

	abstract = {Exosomes are nanosized (30-100 nm) membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types. Exosomes have been found to contain various {RNA} species including {miRNA}, {mRNA} and long non-protein coding {RNAs}. A number of cancer cells produce elevated levels of exosomes. Because exosomes have been isolated from most body fluids they may provide a source for non-invasive cancer diagnostics. Transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies ({RNA}-Seq) offers enormous amount of data that can be used for biomarkers discovery, however, in case of exosomes this approach was applied only for the analysis of small {RNAs}. In this study, we utilized {RNA}-Seq technology to analyze {RNAs} present in microvesicles secreted by human breast cancer cell lines. Exosomes were isolated from the media conditioned by two human breast cancer cell lines, {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {MDA}-{MB}-436. Exosomal {RNA} was profiled using the Ion Torrent semiconductor chip-based technology. Exosomes were found to contain various classes of {RNA} with the major class represented by fragmented ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}), in particular 28S and 18S {rRNA} subunits. Analysis of exosomal {RNA} content revealed that it reflects {RNA} content of the donor cells. Although exosomes produced by the two cancer cell lines shared most of the {RNA} species, there was a number of non-coding transcripts unique to {MDA}-{MB}-231 and {MDA}-{MB}-436 cells. This suggests that {RNA} analysis might distinguish exosomes produced by low metastatic breast cancer cell line ({MDA}-{MB}-436) from that produced by highly metastatic breast cancer cell line ({MDA}-{MB}-231). The analysis of gene ontologies ({GOs}) associated with the most abundant transcripts present in exosomes revealed significant enrichment in genes encoding proteins involved in translation and {rRNA} and {ncRNA} processing. These {GO} terms indicate most expressed genes for both, cellular and exosomal {RNA}. For the first time, using {RNA}-seq, we examined the transcriptomes of exosomes secreted by human breast cancer cells. We found that most abundant exosomal {RNA} species are the fragments of 28S and 18S {rRNA} subunits. This limits the number of reads from other {RNAs}. To increase the number of detectable transcripts and improve the accuracy of their expression level the protocols allowing depletion of fragmented {rRNA} should be utilized in the future {RNA}-seq analyses on exosomes. Present data revealed that exosomal transcripts are representative of their cells of origin and thus could form basis for detection of tumor specific markers.},

This wealth of data can lead to valuable biological insights when analyzed in an integrated manner, but the computational challenge of managing such large data collections is substantial. In order to mine these data efficiently, it is necessary to develop methods that use storage, memory and processing resources carefully. {RESULTS}: The Sleipnir C++ library implements a variety of machine learning and data manipulation algorithms with a focus on heterogeneous data integration and efficiency for very large biological data collections. Sleipnir allows microarray processing, functional ontology mining, clustering, Bayesian learning and inference and support vector machine tasks to be performed for heterogeneous data on scales not previously practical. In addition to the library, which can easily be integrated into new computational systems, prebuilt tools are provided to perform a variety of common tasks. Many tools are multithreaded for parallelization in desktop or high-throughput computing environments, and most tasks can be performed in minutes for hundreds of datasets using a standard personal computer. {AVAILABILITY}: Source code (C++) and documentation are available at http://function.princeton.edu/sleipnir and compiled binaries are available from the authors on request.},

	abstract = {Long noncoding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. In fission yeast, glucose starvation triggers a transcriptional cascade of polyadenylated {lncRNAs} in the upstream region of the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp1(+) ), which is correlated with stepwise chromatin remodeling and necessary for the massive induction of fbp1(+) {mRNA}. Here, we show that these novel metabolic stress-induced {lncRNAs} ({mlonRNAs}) are 5'-capped, less stable than fbp1(+) {mRNA} and sensitive to a certain extent to the nuclear exosome cofactor Rrp6. However, most {mlonRNAs} seem to escape nuclear degradation and are exported to the cytoplasm, where they localize to polysomes precisely during glucose starvation-induced global translation inhibition. It is likely that ribosomes tend to accumulate in the upstream region of {mlonRNAs}. Although {mlonRNAs} contain an unusual amount of upstream {AUGs} ({uAUGs}) and small open reading frames ({uORFs}), they escape Upf1-mediated targeting to the non-sense-mediated decay ({NMD}) pathway. The deletion of Upf1 had no effect on {mlonRNA} stability, but considerably destabilized fbp1(+) {mRNA}, hinting toward a possible novel role of Upf1. Our findings suggest that the stability of {mlonRNAs} is distinctly regulated from {mRNA} and previously described noncoding transcripts.},

On evaluating 429 experiments, representing 238 diseases and 122 tissues from 8435 microarrays, we find evidence for a general, pathophysiological concordance between experiments measuring the same disease condition.

	abstract = {In this work, we integrated prior knowledge from gene signatures and protein interactions with gene set enrichment analysis ({GSEA}), and gene/protein network modeling together to identify gene network signatures from gene expression microarray data. We demonstrated how to apply this approach into discovering gene network signatures for colorectal cancer ({CRC}) from microarray datasets. First, we used {GSEA} to analyze the microarray data through enriching differential genes in different {CRC}-related gene sets from two publicly available up-to-date gene set databases - Molecular Signatures Database ({MSigDB}) and Gene Signatures Database ({GeneSigDB}). Second, we compared the enriched gene sets through enrichment score, false-discovery rate, and nominal p-value. Third, we constructed an integrated protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) network through connecting these enriched genes by high-quality interactions from a human annotated and predicted protein interaction database, with a confidence score labeled for each interaction. Finally, we mapped differential gene expressions onto the constructed network to build a comprehensive network model containing visualized transcriptome and proteome data. The results show that although {MSigDB} has more {CRC}-relevant gene sets than {GeneSigDB}, the integrated {PPI} network connecting the enriched genes from both {MSigDB} and {GeneSigDB} can provide a more complete view for discovering gene network signatures. We also found several important sub-network signatures for {CRC}, such as {TP}53 sub-network, {PCNA} sub-network, and {IL}8 sub-network, corresponding to apoptosis, {DNA} repair, and immune response, respectively.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Age is the strongest breast cancer risk factor, with overall breast cancer risk increasing steadily beginning at approximately 30 years of age. However, while breast cancer risk is lower among younger women, young women's breast cancer may be more aggressive. Although, several genomic and epidemiologic studies have shown higher prevalence of aggressive, estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer in younger women, the age-related gene expression that predisposes to these tumors is poorly understood. Characterizing age-related patterns of gene expression in normal breast tissues may provide insights on etiology of distinct breast cancer subtypes that arise from these tissues.
{METHODS}: To identify age-related changes in normal breast tissue, 96 tissue specimens from patients with reduction mammoplasty, ages 14 to 70 years, were assayed by gene expression microarray.
{RESULTS}: Significant associations between gene expression levels and age were identified for 802 probes (481 increased, 321 decreased with increasing age). Enriched functions included "aging of cells," "shape change," and "chemotaxis," and enriched pathways included Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, Ephrin receptor signaling, and {JAK}/Stat signaling. Applying the age-associated genes to publicly available tumor datasets, the age-associated pathways defined two groups of tumors with distinct survival.
{CONCLUSION}: The hazard rates of young-like tumors mirrored that of high-grade tumors in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, providing a biologic link between normal aging and age-related tumor aggressiveness.
{IMPACT}: These data show that studies of normal tissue gene expression can yield important insights about the pathways and biologic pressures that are relevant during tumor etiology and progression.},

The application of conventional meta-analysis to raw microarray data is complicated by differences in the type of microarray used, gene nomenclatures, species, and analytical methods. An alternative approach to combining multiple microarray studies is to compare the published gene lists which result from the investigators' analyses of the raw data, as implemented in Lists of Lists Annotated ({LOLA}: www.lola.gwu.edu) and L2L (depts.washington.edu/l2l/). The present review considers both the potential value and the limitations of databasing and enabling the comparison of results from different microarray studies.

The Illumina Bovine {SNP}50 {BeadChip} was used to genotype 209 Holstein cows for the {GSEA}-{SNP} analyses. For each of 13,744 annotated genes genome-wide located within 50 kb of a Bovine {SNP}50 {SNP}, the single {SNP} with the highest Cochran-Armitage Max statistic was used as a proxy statistic for that gene's strength of affiliation with Map. Gene-set enrichment was tested using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like running sum statistic with data permutation to adjust for multiple testing. For tissue infection and fecal shedding, no gene sets in {KEGG} pathways or in {GO} sets for molecular function or cellular component were enriched for signal. The {GO} biological process gene set for positive regulation of cell motion ({GO}:0051272, q = 0.039, 5/11 genes contributing to the core enrichment) was enriched for Map tissue infection, while no {GO} biological process gene sets were enriched for fecal shedding. {GSEA}-{SNP} complements traditional {SNP} association approaches to identify genes of modest effects as well as genes with larger effects as demonstrated by the identification of one locus that we previously found to be associated with Map tissue infection using a {SNP}-by-{SNP} genome-wide association study.},

We examined the distribution of site-specific metastases in patients with {UCUB} according to age and we assessed contemporary recommendations proposed by guidelines with regard to distant metastases.
{METHODS}: Patients with metastatic {UCUB} ({mUCUB}) were abstracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1998-2007). Age was stratified into quartiles: ≤63, 64-72, 73-79 and ≥80 years. Cochran-Armitage trend test and multivariable logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between age and the rate of metastases. Finally, we identified patients at high risk of brain or bone metastases.
{RESULTS}: Within 7543 patients with {mUCUB}, 25\%, 24\%, 23\%, 19\%, 18\% and 3\% had lymph node, bone, urinary, lung and liver metastases, respectively. Overall, the rate of concomitant metastases was 29\%. The rate of multiple metastatic sites decreased with increasing age (p {\textless} 0.001). This was confirmed in patients with lung, bone, liver, urinary system and brain metastases (all p ≤ 0.04). The rate of bone metastases was 15.0\% in patients with exclusive abdominal metastases and 40.0\% in patients with abdominal, thoracic and brain metastases. The rate of brain metastases was 1\% in patients with exclusive abdominal metastases and 7\% in patients with thoracic and bone metastases. Our findings are limited by the retrospective nature of the analyses.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We report a higher number of concomitant metastatic sites in young {UCUB} patients. Bone metastases are frequent in all patient groups, whereas brain metastases are common in {UCUB} patients with thoracic and/or bone metastases.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: This review provides a broad overview of emerging data that provide hope that rational precision medicine for metastatic renal cell carcinoma ({RCC}) may be possible.
{METHODS}: {PubMed} and major conferences were searched for studies reporting potential predictive biomarkers for the therapy of metastatic {RCC}.
{RESULTS}: The availability of multiple new agents for the therapy of advanced {RCC} poses new challenges in terms of optimal selection of patients for the appropriate drug. Prognostic stratification based on routine histopathologic, clinical and laboratory factors have been utilized to broadly select individuals based, i.e. high-dose interleukin ({IL})-2 or vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) inhibitors for good and intermediate risk patients and temsirolimus for poor risk patients. While multiple candidate predictive molecular biomarkers suggest that rational selection of patients for high-dose interleukin ({IL})-2, and {VEGF} and mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) inhibitors may be possible, none have been validated for use in the clinic. Tumor heterogeneity and standardization of tissue collection and analysis are massive challenges that need to be addressed. Predictive molecules derived from tumor tissue, plasma and host tissue may all be predictive for therapeutic benefit. Moreover, gene expression may be modulated by multiple factors including epigenetics, transcription factors and post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications. Indeed, study of the interaction of molecular factors from all of these sources with environmental and clinical factors may be necessary to develop a unified profile composed of a panel of factors predictive of benefit from specific agents (i.e. sustained response, limited toxicity and overall a positive benefit/risk ratio).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Conducting clinical trials with 1) prospective incorporation of promising candidate predictive molecular biomarkers, 2) novel biomarkers endpoints, and 3) mandatory biopsies of metastatic sites at different time points on therapy, are potential important steps in developing the concept of "the right medication for the right patient".},

	abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal type of gynecologic malignancy. Sixty percent of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer present with advanced-stage disease that involves the peritoneal cavity and these patients have a 5-year survival rate of less than 30\%. For more than two decades, tumor-debulking surgery followed by platinum-taxane combination chemotherapy has remained the conventional first-line treatment of ovarian cancer. Although the initial response rate is 70\%-80\%, most patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer eventually relapse and succumb to recurrent chemoresistant disease. A number of molecular aberrations that drive tumor progression have been identified in ovarian cancer cells and intensive efforts have focused on developing therapeutic agents that target these aberrations. However, increasing evidence indicates that reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and various types of stromal cells also play important roles in driving ovarian tumor progression and that these stromal cells represent attractive therapeutic targets. Unlike tumor cells, stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment are in general genetically stable and are therefore less likely to become resistant to therapy. This concise review discusses the biological significance of the cross-talk between ovarian cancer cells and three major types of stromal cells (endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages) and the development of new-generation therapies that target the ovarian tumor microenvironment.},

	abstract = {Elucidation of tumor-{DNA} virus associations in many cancer types has enhanced our knowledge of fundamental oncogenesis mechanisms and provided a basis for cancer prevention initiatives. {RNA}-Seq is a novel tool to comprehensively assess such associations. We interrogated {RNA}-Seq data from 3,775 malignant neoplasms in The Cancer Genome Atlas database for the presence of viral sequences. Viral integration sites were also detected in expressed transcripts using a novel approach. The detection capacity of {RNA}-Seq was compared to available clinical laboratory data. Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) transcripts were detected using {RNA}-Seq analysis in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Detection of {HPV} by {RNA}-Seq correlated with detection by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the head and neck. Hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus ({EBV}) were detected using {RNA}-Seq in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma tumors, respectively. Integration sites of viral genes and oncogenes were detected in cancers harboring {HPV} or hepatitis B virus but not in {EBV}-positive gastric carcinoma. Integration sites of expressed viral transcripts frequently involved known coding areas of the host genome. No {DNA} virus transcripts were detected in acute myeloid leukemia, cutaneous melanoma, low- and high-grade gliomas of the brain, and adenocarcinomas of the breast, colon and rectum, lung, prostate, ovary, kidney, and thyroid. In conclusion, this study provides a large-scale overview of the landscape of {DNA} viruses in human malignant cancers. While further validation is necessary for specific cancer types, our findings highlight the utility of {RNA}-Seq in detecting tumor-associated {DNA} viruses and identifying viral integration sites that may unravel novel mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis.},

	doi = {10.1186/bcr3150},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: With the improvement of therapeutic options for the treatment of breast cancer, the development of brain metastases has become a major limitation to life expectancy in many patients. Therefore, our aim was to identify molecular markers associated with the development of brain metastases in breast cancer.
{METHODS}: Patterns of chromosomal aberrations in primary breast tumors and brain metastases were compared with array-comparative genetic hybridization ({CGH}). The most significant region was further characterized in more detail by microsatellite and gene-expression analysis, and finally, the possible target gene was screened for mutations.
{RESULTS}: The array {CGH} results showed that brain metastases, in general, display similar chromosomal aberrations as do primary tumors, but with a notably higher frequency. Statistically significant differences were found at nine different chromosomal loci, with a gain and amplification of {EGFR} (7p11.2) and a loss of 10q22.3-qter being among the most significant aberrations in brain metastases (P {\textless} 0.01; false discovery rate (fdr) {\textless} 0.04). Allelic imbalance ({AI}) patterns at 10q were further verified in 77 unmatched primary tumors and 21 brain metastases. {AI} at {PTEN} loci was found significantly more often in brain metastases (52\%) and primary tumors with a brain relapse (59\%) compared with primary tumors from patients without relapse (18\%; P = 0.003) or relapse other than brain tumors (12\%; P = 0.006). Loss of {PTEN} was especially frequent in {HER}2-negative brain metastases (64\%). Furthermore, {PTEN} {mRNA} expression was significantly downregulated in brain metastases compared with primary tumors, and {PTEN} mutations were frequently found in brain metastases.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results demonstrate that brain metastases often show very complex genomic-aberration patterns, suggesting a potential role of {PTEN} and {EGFR} in brain metastasis formation.},

We are also introduced to several modes of {miRNA} regulation (negative feedback, positive feedback, and cross regulatory) that monitor, modulate, or resolve signaling pathways in a variety of biologic processes that include sepsis response, fibrosis, acute exercise, and steroid biology. Perhaps the homeostasis or micromanagement of these {miRNA} regulatory systems, when perturbed, arrive at new stable networked interactions that have an undesired effect of promoting or antagonizing disease severity and cancer progression.

The overall incidence of {FAEs} with bevacizumab was 2.5\% (95\% {CI}, 1.7\%-3.9\%).

Second, all the normalized data tables are aggregated into a grand data table that is analyzed via a (non-normalized) {PCA} that gives a set of factor scores for the observations and loadings for the variables. In addition, {MFA} provides for each data table a set of partial factor scores for the observations that reflects the specific ‘view-point’ of this data table. Interestingly, the common factor scores could be obtained by replacing the original normalized data tables by the normalized factor scores obtained from the {PCA} of each of these tables.

	abstract = {Most patients with {BRAF}(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective {RAF} kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to {RAF} inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 45 patients with {BRAF}(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative {RAF} inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients (51\%). Besides previously characterized alterations, we discovered a "long tail" of new mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) pathway alterations ({MAP}2K2, {MITF}) that confer {RAF} inhibitor resistance. In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same tumor biopsy. Overall, {RAF} inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving {MAPK} pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of {BRAF}(V600)-mutant melanoma. Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance studies.},

	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0029743},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Bone metastasis is a main cause of morbidity in breast cancer. Since breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, the interactions of cancer cells with the skeletal host cells might also be diverse. We hypothesized that gene expression signatures induced by heterotypic interaction of breast cancer cells and osteoblasts might be of clinical relevance.
{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: We established an ex vivo co-culture model using benign breast epithelial cells or a panel of 5 malignant breast epithelial cells in combination with primary human osteoblasts and determined associated gene expression changes with {HEEBO} microarrays. Pretreatment gene expression profiles of 295 early stage breast cancers published from the Netherlands Cancer Institute with a median follow up of 12.6 years allowed evaluating in vitro effects in the in vivo situation.The effects of the interaction between osteoblasts and breast cancer cell lines of different origin were very heterogeneous. Hs578T cells started to proliferate in co-culture with osteoblasts, {SKBR}-3 induced a {TGF}-β response and {MDA}-{MB}231 cells showed two distinct sets of up-regulated genes: A set of interferon response genes associated with an up-regulation of {STAT}1 was in vivo remarkably coherent providing a basis for segregation of tumors into two groups. In a uni-variate analysis, early stage tumors with high expression levels (n = 136) of this gene set had a significantly lower overall survival rate (p = 0.005) (63\% at 10 years) than tumors with low expression levels (n = 159) (overall survival: 77\% at 10 years). The second gene set was associated with {IL}-6 and did not significantly change the overall survival rate (p = 0.165), but was significantly associated with a shorter time to bone metastasis (p = 0.049; 74\% vs. 83\% at 10 years).
{CONCLUSION}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: An {IL}-6 gene expression pattern induced by heterotypic interaction of breast cancer cells with osteoblasts in vitro is associated with a higher rate of bone metastasis in vivo.},

	abstract = {Tumor cells in bone can induce the activation of osteoclasts, which mediate bone resorption and release of growth factors and calcium from the bone matrix, resulting in a cycle of tumor growth and bone breakdown. Targeting the bone microenvironment by the inhibition of {RANKL}, an essential mediator of osteoclast function, not only prevents tumor-induced osteolysis but also decreases skeletal tumor burden in preclinical models. The inhibition of skeletal tumor progression after the inhibition of osteoclasts is via interruption of the "vicious cycle" of tumor/bone interactions. The majority of breast cancer patients at risk for bone metastases harbor estrogen receptor-positive ({ER}+) tumors. We developed a mouse model for {ER}+ breast cancer bone metastasis and evaluated the effect of {RANKL} inhibition on tumor-induced osteolysis and skeletal tumor growth both alone and in combination with tamoxifen. Luciferase-labeled {MCF}-7 cells ({MCF}-7Luc) formed metastatic foci in the hind limbs following intracardiac injection and caused mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic lesions. {RANKL} inhibition by {OPG}-Fc treatment blocked osteoclast activity and prevented tumor-induced osteolysis, as well as caused a marked decrease in skeletal tumor burden. Tamoxifen as a single agent reduced {MCF}-7Luc tumor growth in the hind limbs. In a combination experiment, {OPG}-Fc plus tamoxifen resulted in significantly greater tumor growth inhibition than either single agent alone. Histologic analysis revealed a decrease in the proliferation of tumor cells by both single agents, which was enhanced in the combination treatment. Upon treatment with {OPG}-Fc alone or in combination with tamoxifen, there was a complete absence of osteolytic lesions, demonstrating the ability of {RANKL} inhibition to prevent skeletal related morbidity in an {ER}+ model. The combination approach of targeting osteoclasts and the bone microenvironment by {RANKL} inhibition and the tumor directly via hormonal therapy may provide additional benefit to reducing skeletal tumor progression in {ER}+ breast cancer patients.},

Subtype definitions were as follows: luminal A ({ER}+ and/or progesterone receptor positive [{PR}+], {HER}2-), luminal B ({ER}+ and/or {PR}+, {HER}2+), basal-like ({ER}-, {PR}-, {HER}2-, cytokeratin 5/6 positive, and/or {HER}1+), {HER}2+/{ER}- ({ER}-, {PR}-, and {HER}2+), and unclassified (negative for all 5 markers). {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: We examined the prevalence of breast cancer subtypes within racial and menopausal subsets and determined their associations with tumor size, axillary nodal status, mitotic index, nuclear pleomorphism, combined grade, p53 mutation status, and breast cancer-specific survival. {RESULTS}: The basal-like breast cancer subtype was more prevalent among premenopausal African American women (39\%) compared with postmenopausal African American women (14\%) and non-African American women (16\%) of any age (P{\textless}.001), whereas the luminal A subtype was less prevalent (36\% vs 59\% and 54\%, respectively). The {HER}2+/{ER}- subtype did not vary with race or menopausal status (6\%-9\%). Compared with luminal A, basal-like tumors had more {TP}53 mutations (44\% vs 15\%, P{\textless}.001), higher mitotic index (odds ratio [{OR}], 11.0; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 5.6-21.7), more marked nuclear pleomorphism ({OR}, 9.7; 95\% {CI}, 5.3-18.0), and higher combined grade ({OR}, 8.3; 95\% {CI}, 4.4-15.6). Breast cancer-specific survival differed by subtype (P{\textless}.001), with shortest survival among {HER}2+/{ER}- and basal-like subtypes. {CONCLUSIONS}: Basal-like breast tumors occurred at a higher prevalence among premenopausal African American patients compared with postmenopausal African American and non-African American patients in this population-based study. A higher prevalence of basal-like breast tumors and a lower prevalence of luminal A tumors could contribute to the poor prognosis of young African American women with breast cancer.},

The effect of {miR}-203 and ΔNp63 on cell proliferation was determined in cells transfected with {miR}-203 mimic and ΔNp63 small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}), respectively. The regulation of ΔNp63 expression in {ESCC} cells by {miR}-203 was studied by luciferase reporter assay, {RT}-{PCR} and western blot analysis in cells transfected with {miR}-203. The effect of ΔNp63 re-expression on {miR}-203 induced inhibition of cell proliferation was studied by cell proliferation assay in cells cotransfected with {miR}-203 and {pcDNA}-ΔNp63 plasmid (without the 3'-{UTR} of ΔNp63). {RESULTS} We found that both {miR}-203 and ΔNp63 {siRNA} signicantly inhibited cell proliferation in {ESCC}. {MiR}-203 could down-regulate endogenous ΔNp63 expression at the posttranscriptional level. Moreover, re-expression of ΔNp63 in cells transfected with {miR}-203 significantly attenuated the {miR}-203 induced inhibition of cell proliferation. {CONCLUSIONS} Our data implied that {miR}-203 could inhibit cell proliferation in human {ESCC} through ΔNp63-mediated signal pathway.

	abstract = {Motivation: Modern functional genomics generates high-dimensional datasets. It is often convenient to have a single simple number characterizing the relationship between pairs of such high-dimensional datasets in a comprehensive way. Matrix correlations are such numbers and are appealing since they can be interpreted in the same way as Pearson's correlations familiar to biologists. The high-dimensionality of functional genomics data is, however, problematic for existing matrix correlations. The motivation of this article is 2-fold: (i) we introduce the idea of matrix correlations to the bioinformatics community and (ii) we give an improvement of the most promising matrix correlation coefficient (the {RV}-coefficient) circumventing the problems of high-dimensional data. The modified {RV}-coefficient can be used in high-dimensional data analysis studies as an easy measure of common information of two datasets. This is shown by theoretical arguments, simulations and applications to two real-life examples from functional genomics, i.e. a transcriptomics and metabolomics example.

	abstract = {Epithelial-stromal interactions play a crucial role in normal embryonic development and carcinogenesis of the human breast while the underlying mechanisms of these events remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we constructed a physiologically relevant, three-dimensional (3D) culture surrogate of complex human breast tissue that included a tri-culture system made up of human mammary epithelial cells ({MCF}10A), human fibroblasts and adipocytes, i.e., the two dominant breast stromal cell types, in a Matrigel/collagen mixture on porous silk protein scaffolds. The presence of stromal cells inhibited {MCF}10A cell proliferation and induced both alveolar and ductal morphogenesis and enhanced casein expression. In contrast to the immature polarity exhibited by co-cultures with either fibroblasts or adipocytes, the alveolar structures formed by the tri-cultures exhibited proper polarity similar to that observed in breast tissue in vivo. Only alveolar structures with reverted polarity were observed in {MCF}10A monocultures. Consistent with their phenotypic appearance, more functional differentiation of epithelial cells was also observed in the tri-cultures, where casein alpha- and -beta {mRNA} expression was significantly increased. This in vitro tri-culture breast tissue system sustained on silk scaffold effectively represents a more physiologically relevant 3D microenvironment for mammary epithelial cells and stromal cells than either co-cultures or monocultures. This experimental model provides an important first step for bioengineering an informative human breast tissue system, with which to study normal breast morphogenesis and neoplastic transformation.},

Moreover, {AdF}512v1 replication in tumor models was enhanced 15–40-fold when the tumor contained a mix of malignant and {SPARC}-expressing stromal cells (fibroblasts and endothelial cells). Contrary to the wild-type virus, {AdF}512v1 was unable to replicate in normal human ovary samples while the wild-type virus can replicate.

	abstract = {Neuroendocrine tumors ({NETs}) describe a heterogeneous group of tumors with a wide range of morphologic, functional, and behavioral characteristics. These tumors are often indolent but they have the potential to cause symptoms through release of hormones and through local or distant spread. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ({pNET}) represent a subset of {NETs} and they have a unique pattern of symptoms and disease progression. Due to the heterogeneity of this disease it is important to identify reliable markers to help guide prognosis and predict response to therapy. The recent approval of two new agents in the treatment of advanced {pNET} has raised additional interest in the significance of molecular markers in this disease. At the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology ({ASCO}) Annual Meeting, several investigators reported on collaborative efforts to develop clinically useful biomarkers for this disease. Choti et al. (Abstract \#4126) reported data about the functional characteristics of {NETs} and {pNETs} among a multi-institutional cohort finding that a substantial minority of patients have functional symptoms even when the disease is localized. Faggiano et al. (Abstract \#1604) looked at a wide spectrum of {NETs} in several referral centers and reported on predictors of both short term and long term survival in this setting. Yao et al. (Abstract \#4014) reported analysis of predictive biomarkers among patients in the {RADIANT}-2 trial which looked at the role of the {mTOR} inhibitor, everolimus compared to placebo in {NET}. Fischer et al. (Abstract \#4128) looked at a novel biomarker, placental growth factor ({PlGF}) and evaluated the role of serum and tissue levels of this protein as a predictive marker. Finally, Khan et al. (Abstract \#4123) investigated the role of circulating tumor cells in {NET} (and {pNET}) and found that this may have potential as a prognostic marker and an early marker of response to therapy.

Little attention has been paid to understanding how genetic variations, altered gene expression and {microRNA} ({miRNA}) expression are integrated into networks which act together to alter regulation and finally lead to the emergence of complex phenotypes and glioblastoma. {RESULTS} We identified association of somatic mutations in 14 genes with glioblastoma, of which 8 genes are newly identified, and association of loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}) is identified in 11 genes with glioblastoma, of which 9 genes are newly discovered. By gene coexpression network analysis, we identified 15 genes essential to the function of the network, most of which are cancer related genes. We also constructed {miRNA} coexpression networks and found 19 important {miRNAs} of which 3 were significantly related to glioblastoma patients' survival. We identified 3,953 predicted {miRNA}-{mRNA} pairs, of which 14 were previously verified by experiments in other groups. Using pathway enrichment analysis we also found that the genes in the target network of the top 19 important {miRNAs} were mainly involved in cancer related signaling pathways, synaptic transmission and nervous systems processes. Finally, we developed new methods to decipher the pathway connecting mutations, expression information and glioblastoma. We identified 4 cis-expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}): {TP}53, {EGFR}, {NF}1 and {PIK}3C2G; 262 trans {eQTL} and 26 trans {miRNA} {eQTL} for somatic mutation; 2 cis-{eQTL}: {NRAP} and {EGFR}; 409 trans- {eQTL} and 27 trans- {miRNA} {eQTL} for lost of heterozygosity ({LOH}) mutation. {CONCLUSIONS} Our results demonstrate that integrated analysis of multi-dimensional data has the potential to unravel the mechanism of tumor initiation and progression.},

It is likely that many genes that might be useful for diagnosis and/or prognostication of human malignancies have yet to be recognized. The advent of {cDNA} microarray technology now allows the efficient measurement of expression for almost every gene in the human genome in a single overnight hybridization experiment. This genomic scale approach has begun to reveal novel molecular-based sub-classes of tumours in breast carcinoma, colon carcinoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, and melanoma. In several instances, gene microarray analysis has already identified genes that appear to be useful for predicting clinical behaviour.

	abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death for women in the U.S. and the seventh most fatal worldwide. Although ovarian cancer is notable for its initial sensitivity to platinum-based therapies, the vast majority of patients eventually develop recurrent cancer and succumb to increasingly platinum-resistant disease. Modern, targeted cancer drugs intervene in cell signaling, and identifying key disease mechanisms and pathways would greatly advance our treatment abilities. In order to shed light on the molecular diversity of ovarian cancer, we performed comprehensive transcriptional profiling on 129 advanced stage, high grade serous ovarian cancers. We implemented a, re-sampling based version of the {ISIS} class discovery algorithm ({rISIS}: robust {ISIS}) and applied it to the entire set of ovarian cancer transcriptional profiles. {rISIS} identified a previously undescribed patient stratification, further supported by micro-{RNA} expression profiles, and gene set enrichment analysis found strong biological support for the stratification by extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis genes. The corresponding "angiogenesis signature" was validated in ten published independent ovarian cancer gene expression datasets and is significantly associated with overall survival. The subtypes we have defined are of potential translational interest as they may be relevant for identifying patients who may benefit from the addition of anti-angiogenic therapies that are now being tested in clinical trials.},

The most popular platform for genome-wide expression profiling is the Affymetrix {GeneChip}. However, its selection of probes relied on earlier genome and transcriptome annotation which is significantly different from current knowledge. The resultant informatics problems have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here, we address these critical issues and offer a solution. We identified several classes of problems at the individual probe level in the existing annotation, under the assumption that current genome and transcriptome databases are more accurate than those used for {GeneChip} design. We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular {GeneChips} into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of up-to-date genome, {cDNA}/{EST} clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing analysis results between the original and the redefined probe sets reveals ∼30–50\% discrepancy in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived from past {GeneChip} analyses may be significantly flawed. It will be beneficial to re-analyze existing {GeneChip} data with updated probe set definitions.},

In this study, we use penalized latent variable regression methods for joint modeling of multiple omics data types to identify common latent variables that can be used to cluster patient samples into biologically and clinically relevant disease subtypes. We consider lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), elastic net (Zou and Hastie, 2005), and fused lasso (Tibshirani et al., 2005) methods to induce sparsity in the coefficient vectors, revealing important genomic features that have significant contributions to the latent variables. An iterative ridge regression is used to compute the sparse coefficient vectors. In model selection, a uniform design (Fang and Wang, 1994) is used to seek "experimental" points that scattered uniformly across the search domain for efficient sampling of tuning parameter combinations. We compared our method to sparse singular value decomposition ({SVD}) and penalized Gaussian mixture model ({GMM}) using both real and simulated data sets. The proposed method is applied to integrate genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data for subtype analysis in breast and lung cancer data sets.},

Microvesicles ({MVs}) are fragments of the plasma membrane secreted from cytoplasmic membrane compartments by normal and malignant cells. An increase in {MV} number has been found in peripheral blood of patients with several diseases including cancer. We hypothesized that {MV} number and the relative amount of focal adhesion kinase ({FAK}) and epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) proteins in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} are related to the presence of breast cancer.
{METHODS}: Plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} were obtained by differential centrifugation of blood samples. {MV} number was evaluated by {BD} {TruCOUNT} Tubes ({BD} Biosciences). {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins were analyzed by Western blot.
{RESULTS}: {MV} number in plasma fractions enriched with {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} is higher in breast cancer patients with stages I-{IV} as well as with T2-T4 tumors, in comparison to control group. In addition, plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} present {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins and their amount is increased in some stages of breast cancer in comparison to control group.

	abstract = {A major goal in translational cancer research is to identify biological signatures driving cancer progression and metastasis. A common technique applied in genomics research is to cluster patients using gene expression data from a candidate prognostic gene set, and if the resulting clusters show statistically significant outcome stratification, to associate the gene set with prognosis, suggesting its biological and clinical importance. Recent work has questioned the validity of this approach by showing in several breast cancer data sets that "random" gene sets tend to cluster patients into prognostically variable subgroups. This work suggests that new rigorous statistical methods are needed to identify biologically informative prognostic gene sets. To address this problem, we developed Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures ({SAPS}) which integrates standard prognostic tests with a new prognostic significance test based on stratifying patients into prognostic subtypes with random gene sets. {SAPS} ensures that a significant gene set is not only able to stratify patients into prognostically variable groups, but is also enriched for genes showing strong univariate associations with patient prognosis, and performs significantly better than random gene sets. We use {SAPS} to perform a large meta-analysis (the largest completed to date) of prognostic pathways in breast and ovarian cancer and their molecular subtypes. Our analyses show that only a small subset of the gene sets found statistically significant using standard measures achieve significance by {SAPS}. We identify new prognostic signatures in breast and ovarian cancer and their corresponding molecular subtypes, and we show that prognostic signatures in {ER} negative breast cancer are more similar to prognostic signatures in ovarian cancer than to prognostic signatures in {ER} positive breast cancer. {SAPS} is a powerful new method for deriving robust prognostic biological signatures from clinically annotated genomic datasets.},

Male Wistar rats received a single or repeated i.p. injection of {LPS} (100 microg/kg) for 6 days and were subdivided into four groups: 6 saline, 5 saline+1 {LPS}, 5 {LPS}+1 saline and 6 {LPS}. Animals with a single exposure to {LPS} showed increased plasma levels of {ACTH}, {CORT}, {PRL}, {TNF}-alpha and also {CRF} {mRNA} in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. These animals exhibited a reduced food intake and body weight associated with an increase of {CART} expression in the arcuate nucleus ({ARC}). Leptin plasma levels were not altered. On the other hand, repeated {LPS} administration did not alter {ACTH}, {CORT}, {PRL} and {TNF}-alpha, but it reduced leptin level, compared to single {LPS} or saline treatment. Furthermore, repeated {LPS} administration did not increase {CRF} or {CART} {mRNA} expression. Food intake and weight gain after repeated {LPS} injections were not different from saline-treated animals. There was no change in {NPY} and {POMC} {mRNA} expression in the {ARC} after single or repeated injections of {LPS}. In conclusion, desensitization induced by repeated exposure to {LPS} involves the blockade of {HPA} axis activation and anorexigenic response, which are both associated with an unresponsiveness of {TNF}-alpha production and {CRF} and {CART} expression in the hypothalamus.},

Modulated genes and pathways were identified in the various groups using Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Global Testing. Bone relapse patients were most abundant in the luminal subtypes but were found less than expected in the basal subtype. The reverse was true for lung and brain relapse patients with the remark that absence of lung relapse was luminal A specific. Finally, a pleura relapse, although rare, was found almost exclusively in both luminal subtypes. Many differentially expressed genes were identified, of which several were in common in a subtype and the site to which the subtype preferentially relapsed. {WNT} signaling was up-regulated in the basal subtype and in brain-specific relapse, and down-modulated in the luminal B subtype and in bone-specific relapse. Focal adhesion was found up-regulated in the luminal A subtype but down-regulated in lung relapse. The five major molecular subtypes in breast cancer are evidently different with regard to their ability to metastasize to distant organ(s), and share biological features and pathways with their preferred distant metastatic site.},

	volume = {10},
	issn = {1471-2105},
	abstract = {Background In contemporary biology, complex biological processes are increasingly studied by collecting and analyzing measurements of the same entities that are collected with different analytical platforms. Such data comprise a number of data blocks that are coupled via a common mode. The goal of collecting this type of data is to discover biological mechanisms that underlie the behavior of the variables in the different data blocks. The simultaneous component analysis ({SCA}) family of data analysis methods is suited for this task. However, a {SCA} may be hampered by the data blocks being subjected to different amounts of measurement error, or noise. To unveil the true mechanisms underlying the data, it could be fruitful to take noise heterogeneity into consideration in the data analysis. Maximum likelihood based {SCA} ({MxLSCA}-P) was developed for this purpose. In a previous simulation study it outperformed normal {SCA}-P. This previous study, however, did not mimic in many respects typical functional genomics data sets, such as, data blocks coupled via the experimental mode, more variables than experimental units, and medium to high correlations between variables. Here, we present a new simulation study in which the usefulness of {MxLSCA}-P compared to ordinary {SCA}-P is evaluated within a typical functional genomics setting. Subsequently, the performance of the two methods is evaluated by analysis of a real life Escherichia coli metabolomics data set. Results In the simulation study, {MxLSCA}-P outperforms {SCA}-P in terms of recovery of the true underlying scores of the common mode and of the true values underlying the data entries. {MxLSCA}-P further performed especially better when the simulated data blocks were subject to different noise levels. In the analysis of an E. coli metabolomics data set, {MxLSCA}-P provided a slightly better and more consistent interpretation. Conclusion {MxLSCA}-P is a promising addition to the {SCA} family. The analysis of coupled functional genomics data blocks could benefit from its ability to take different noise levels per data block into consideration and improve the recovery of the true patterns underlying the data. Moreover, the maximum likelihood based approach underlying {MxLSCA}-P could be extended to custom-made solutions to specific problems encountered.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Clustering is a useful exploratory technique for the analysis of gene expression data. Many different heuristic clustering algorithms have been proposed in this context. Clustering algorithms based on probability models offer a principled alternative to heuristic algorithms. In particular, model-based clustering assumes that the data is generated by a finite mixture of underlying probability distributions such as multivariate normal distributions. The issues of selecting a 'good' clustering method and determining the 'correct' number of clusters are reduced to model selection problems in the probability framework. Gaussian mixture models have been shown to be a powerful tool for clustering in many applications.
{RESULTS}: We benchmarked the performance of model-based clustering on several synthetic and real gene expression data sets for which external evaluation criteria were available. The model-based approach has superior performance on our synthetic data sets, consistently selecting the correct model and the number of clusters. On real expression data, the model-based approach produced clusters of quality comparable to a leading heuristic clustering algorithm, but with the key advantage of suggesting the number of clusters and an appropriate model. We also explored the validity of the Gaussian mixture assumption on different transformations of real data. We also assessed the degree to which these real gene expression data sets fit multivariate Gaussian distributions both before and after subjecting them to commonly used data transformations. Suitably chosen transformations seem to result in reasonable fits.

These primarily involve the biological diversity of genomic data, which can be masked or misrepresented in overly simplified global evaluations. We describe systems for preserving information about biological context during dataset evaluation, which can help to ensure that multiple different evaluations are more directly comparable.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} To compare clinical, immunohistochemical ({IHC}), and gene expression models of prognosis applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks in a large series of estrogen receptor ({ER})-positive breast cancers from patients uniformly treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN} Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-{PCR} ({qRT}-{PCR}) assays for 50 genes identifying intrinsic breast cancer subtypes were completed on 786 specimens linked to clinical (median follow-up, 11.7 years) and {IHC} [{ER}, progesterone receptor ({PR}), {HER}2, and Ki67] data. Performance of predefined intrinsic subtype and risk-of-relapse scores was assessed using multivariable Cox models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Harrell's C-index was used to compare fixed models trained in independent data sets, including proliferation signatures. {RESULTS} Despite clinical {ER} positivity, 10\% of cases were assigned to nonluminal subtypes. {qRT}-{PCR} signatures for proliferation genes gave more prognostic information than clinical assays for hormone receptors or Ki67. In Cox models incorporating standard prognostic variables, hazard ratios for breast cancer disease-specific survival over the first 5 years of follow-up, relative to the most common luminal A subtype, are 1.99 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 1.09-3.64] for luminal B, 3.65 (95\% {CI}, 1.64-8.16) for {HER}2-enriched subtype, and 17.71 (95\% {CI}, 1.71-183.33) for the basal-like subtype. For node-negative disease, {PAM}50 {qRT}-{PCR}-based risk assignment weighted for tumor size and proliferation identifies a group with {\textgreater}95\% 10-year survival without chemotherapy. In node-positive disease, {PAM}50-based prognostic models were also superior. {CONCLUSION} The {PAM}50 gene expression test for intrinsic biological subtype can be applied to large series of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancers, and gives more prognostic information than clinical factors and {IHC} using standard cut points.},

	abstract = {The ability to predict metastatic potential could be of great clinical importance, however, it is uncertain if predicting metastasis to specific vital organs is feasible. As a first step in evaluating metastatic predictions, we analyzed multiple primary tumors and metastasis pairs and determined that {\textgreater}90\% of 298 gene expression signatures were found to be similarly expressed between matched pairs of tumors and metastases; therefore, primary tumors may be a good predictor of metastatic propensity. Next, using a dataset of {\textgreater}1,000 human breast tumor gene expression microarrays we determined that {HER}2-enriched subtype tumors aggressively spread to the liver, while basal-like and claudin-low subtypes colonize the brain and lung. Correspondingly, brain and lung metastasis signatures, along with embryonic stem cell, tumor initiating cell, and hypoxia signatures, were also strongly expressed in the basal-like and claudin-low tumors. Interestingly, low "Differentiation Scores," or high expression of the aforementioned signatures, further predicted for brain and lung metastases. In total, these data identify that depending upon the organ of relapse, a combination of gene expression signatures most accurately predicts metastatic behavior.},

In combination with regulatory network information, we define three {ES} cell modules (Core, Polycomb, and Myc) and show that the modules are functionally separable, illustrating that the overall {ES} cell transcription program is composed of distinct units. With these modules as an analytical tool, we have reassessed the hypothesis linking an {ES} cell signature with cancer or cancer stem cells. We find that the Myc module, independent of the Core module, is active in various cancers and predicts cancer outcome.

Systemic administration of {IL}-18 has been shown to have significant antitumor activity in several preclinical animal models. Phase I clinical trials of recombinant human {IL}-18 have demonstrated that it can be safely administered to patients with advanced cancer. Biologic effects of {IL}-18 therapy include activation of monocytes, {NK} cells, and T cells and production of {IFN}-γ as well as other cytokines in vivo. A phase {II} study of {IL}-18 in patients with metastatic melanoma confirmed its safety but suggested limited efficacy of {IL}-18 monotherapy in this setting. {IL}-18 appears to act predominantly as a costimulatory cytokine and its optimal use for cancer immunotherapy may be in combination with other immunostimulatory cytokines, vaccines, or monoclonal antibodies.},

	abstract = {Macroautophagy (autophagy hereafter) is a catabolic process by which cells degrade intracellular components in lysosomes. This cellular garbage disposal and intracellular recycling system maintains cellular homeostasis by eliminating superfluous or damaged proteins and organelles and invading microbes and by providing substrates for energy generation and biosynthesis in stress. Autophagy thus promotes the health of cells and animals and is critical for the development, differentiation, and maintenance of cell function and for the host defense against pathogens. Deregulation of autophagy is linked to susceptibility to various disorders including degenerative diseases, metabolic syndrome, aging, infectious diseases, and cancer. Autophagic activity emerges as a critical factor in the development and progression of diseases that are associated with increased cancer risk as well as in different stages of cancer. Given that cancer is a complex process and autophagy exerts its effects in multiple ways, the role of autophagy in tumorigenesis is context-dependent. As a cytoprotective survival pathway, autophagy prevents chronic tissue damage that can lead to cancer initiation and progression. In this setting, stimulation or restoration of autophagy may prevent cancer. In contrast, once cancer occurs, many cancer cells upregulate basal autophagy and utilize autophagy to enhance fitness and survive in the hostile tumor microenvironment. These findings revealed the concept that aggressive cancers can be addicted to autophagy for survival. In this setting, autophagy inhibition is a therapeutic strategy for established cancers.},

Reformulating this multilinear {HOSVD} such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this {HOSVD} with an integration of genome-scale {mRNA} expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression.

A subset of colorectal cancer displayed high infiltration with activated {CD}8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte ({CTL}) as well as activated Th1 cells characterized by {IFNγ} production and the Th1 transcription factor {TBET}. Parallel analysis of tumor genotypes revealed that virtually all of the tumors with this active Th1/{CTL} microenvironment had defects in mismatch repair, as evidenced by microsatellite instability ({MSI}). Counterbalancing this active Th1/{CTL} microenvironment, {MSI} tumors selectively demonstrated highly upregulated expression of multiple immune checkpoints, including five-{PD}-1, {PD}-L1, {CTLA}-4, {LAG}-3, and {IDO}-currently being targeted clinically with inhibitors. These findings link tumor genotype with the immune microenvironment, and explain why {MSI} tumors are not naturally eliminated despite a hostile Th1/{CTL} microenvironment. They further suggest that blockade of specific checkpoints may be selectively efficacious in the {MSI} subset of colorectal cancer.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: The findings reported in this article are the first to demonstrate a link between a genetically defined subtype of cancer and its corresponding expression of immune checkpoints in the tumor microenvironment.

The origin of exosomes was identified by immunoelectronmicroscopy ({IEM}). The growth curve of the tumor cell line {SKOV}3 cultured with or without exosomes was analyzed. The apoptosis of autogeneic tumor cells ({ATCs}) and {SKOV}3 cells affected by exosomes was measured by flow cytometry ({FCM}) and light phase contrast microscopy. The cytotoxic effect of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}) stimulated by exosomes and/or dendritic cells ({DCs}) on ovarian cancer cells was measured using a {CCK}-8 assay. The levels of {IFN}-γ released by {PBMCs} stimulated by exosomes and/or {DCs} were measured by {ELISA}. The apoptosis of {PBMCs} and {DCs} affected by exosomes was measured by {FCM} and light microscopy. Whether the mature process of {DCs} was affected by exosomes was studied by {FCM}. The ratio of {CD}4+ T cell and {CD}8+ T cell were measured by {FCM}. {FasL} and {TRAIL} molecules on exosomes were detected by western blot analysis. The human {FasL} antagonistic antibody was used to block the apoptosis of {DCs} and {PBMCs} induced by exosomes. The receptors of {TRAIL} {DR}4 and {DR}5 on {PBMCs} and {DCs} were detected by {FCM}. In 41 patients examined, we isolated exosomes from the ascites of 35 patients. We detected {TCR}, {CD}20, {HLA}-{DR}, B7-2, {HER}2/neu, {CA}125 and Histone H2A on exosomes. We found that exosomes might impair the cytotoxic activity of {PBMCs} when {DCs} are present. We found that exosomes had no effect on the growth and apoptosis of {SKOV}3 cells. However, exosomes may induce apoptosis of precursors, mature {DCs} and {PBMCs}. We found that {FasL} and {TRAIL} were present in the exosome suspension and addition of an anti-{FasL} antibody may decrease the percentage of apoptosis of {DCs} and {PBMCs}. We conclude that exosomes exist in ascites of 85.4\% of patients with ovarian cancer. Moreover, these exosomes may be of multi-origin. Exosomes had no effect on the growth and apoptosis of tumor cells but impaired the cytotoxic activity of {PBMCs} in the presence of {DCs}. Exosomes also may induce apoptosis of the precursors of {DCs}, {DCs} and {PBMCs}. {FasL} and {TRAIL} on exosomes may partly account for the apoptosis of cells of the immune system.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-10-246},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Data integration is currently one of the main challenges in the biomedical sciences. Often different pieces of information are gathered on the same set of entities (e.g., tissues, culture samples, biomolecules) with the different pieces stemming, for example, from different measurement techniques. This implies that more and more data appear that consist of two or more data arrays that have a shared mode. An integrative analysis of such coupled data should be based on a simultaneous analysis of all data arrays. In this respect, the family of simultaneous component methods (e.g., {SUM}-{PCA}, unrestricted {PCovR}, {MFA}, {STATIS}, and {SCA}-P) is a natural choice. Yet, different simultaneous component methods may lead to quite different results.
{RESULTS}: We offer a structured overview of simultaneous component methods that frames them in a principal components setting such that both the common core of the methods and the specific elements with regard to which they differ are highlighted. An overview of principles is given that may guide the data analyst in choosing an appropriate simultaneous component method. Several theoretical and practical issues are illustrated with an empirical example on metabolomics data for Escherichia coli as obtained with different analytical chemical measurement methods.
{CONCLUSION}: Of the aspects in which the simultaneous component methods differ, pre-processing and weighting are consequential. Especially, the type of weighting of the different matrices is essential for simultaneous component analysis. These types are shown to be linked to different specifications of the idea of a fair integration of the different coupled arrays.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Most supervised classification methods are limited by the requirement for more cases than variables. In microarray data the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of cases (arrays), and thus filtering and pre-selection of genes is required. We describe the application of Between Group Analysis ({BGA}) to the analysis of microarray data. A feature of {BGA} is that it can be used when the number of variables (genes) exceeds the number of cases (arrays). {BGA} is based on carrying out an ordination of groups of samples, using a standard method such as Correspondence Analysis ({COA}), rather than an ordination of the individual microarray samples. As such, it can be viewed as a method of carrying out {COA} with grouped data. {RESULTS}: We illustrate the power of the method using two cancer data sets. In both cases, we can quickly and accurately classify test samples from any number of specified a priori groups and identify the genes which characterize these groups. We obtained very high rates of correct classification, as determined by jack-knife or validation experiments with training and test sets. The results are comparable to those from other methods in terms of accuracy but the power and flexibility of {BGA} make it an especially attractive method for the analysis of microarray cancer data.},

	abstract = {Ultraconservation, defined as perfect human-to-rodent sequence identity at least 200-bp long, is a strong indicator of evolutionary and functional importance and has been explored extensively at the genome level. However, it has not been investigated at the transcript level, where such extreme conservation might highlight loci with important post-transcriptional regulatory roles. We present 96 ultraconserved {cDNA} segments ({UCSs}), stretches of human mature {mRNAs} that match identically with orthologous regions in the mouse and rat genomes. {UCSs} can span multiple exons, a feature we leverage here to elucidate the role of ultraconservation in post-transcriptional regulation. {UCS} sites are implicated in functions at essentially every post-transcriptional stage: pre-{mRNA} splicing and degradation through alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay ({AS}-{NMD}), mature {mRNA} silencing by {miRNA}, fast {mRNA} decay rate and translational repression by upstream {AUGs}. We also found {UCSs} to exhibit resistance to formation of {RNA} secondary structure. These multiple layers of regulation underscore the importance of the {UCS}-containing genes as key global {RNA} processing regulators, including members of the serine/arginine-rich protein and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein ({hnRNP}) families of essential splicing regulators. The discovery of {UCSs} shed new light on the multifaceted, fine-tuned and tight post-transcriptional regulation of gene families as conserved through the majority of the mammalian lineage.},

While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that, given certain conditions, any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and reveal how stochasticity in single-cell behaviors promotes phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells.},

To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging ({CS}-{BLI}) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. {CS}-{BLI} is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, {NF}-{kappaB}, {HIF}-1alpha, myc, {hTERT} and {IRF}4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, {CS}-{BLI} can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of {CS}-{BLI}, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.},

We demonstrate that {CAFs} have greater ability than {NFs} to enhance the tumorigenicity of lung cancer cell lines. Microarray gene-expression analysis of the 15 matched {CAF} and {NF} cell lines identified 46 differentially expressed genes, encoding for proteins that are significantly enriched for extracellular proteins regulated by the {TGF}-β signaling pathway. We have identified a subset of 11 genes (13 probe sets) that formed a prognostic gene-expression signature, which was validated in multiple independent {NSCLC} microarray datasets. Functional annotation using protein-protein interaction analyses of these and published cancer stroma-associated gene-expression changes revealed prominent involvement of the focal adhesion and {MAPK} signaling pathways. Fourteen (30\%) of the 46 genes also were differentially expressed in laser-capture-microdissected corresponding primary tumor stroma compared with the matched normal lung. Six of these 14 genes could be induced by {TGF}-β1 in {NF}. The results establish the prognostic impact of {CAF}-associated gene-expression changes in {NSCLC} patients.},

	abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Efforts at early detection and new therapeutic approaches to reduce mortality have been largely unsuccessful, because the origin and pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer are poorly understood. Despite numerous studies that have carefully scrutinized the ovaries for precursor lesions, none have been found. This has led to the proposal that ovarian cancer develops de novo. Studies have shown that epithelial ovarian cancer is not a single disease but is composed of a diverse group of tumors that can be classified based on distinctive morphologic and molecular genetic features. One group of tumors, designated type I, is composed of low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous and transitional (Brenner) carcinomas. These tumors generally behave in an indolent fashion, are confined to the ovary at presentation and, as a group, are relatively genetically stable. They lack mutations of {TP}53, but each histologic type exhibits a distinctive molecular genetic profile. Moreover, the carcinomas exhibit a shared lineage with the corresponding benign cystic neoplasm, often through an intermediate (borderline tumor) step, supporting the morphologic continuum of tumor progression. In contrast, another group of tumors, designated type {II}, is highly aggressive, evolves rapidly and almost always presents in advanced stage. Type {II} tumors include conventional high-grade serous carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, and malignant mixed mesodermal tumors (carcinosarcoma). They {displayTP}53 mutations in over 80\% of cases and rarely harbor the mutations that are found in the type I tumors. Recent studies have also provided cogent evidence that what have been traditionally thought to be primary ovarian tumors actually originate in other pelvic organs and involve the ovary secondarily. Thus, it has been proposed that serous tumors arise from the implantation of epithelium (benign or malignant) from the fallopian tube. Endometrioid and clear cell tumors have been associated with endometriosis that is regarded as the precursor of these tumors. As it is generally accepted that endometriosis develops from endometrial tissue by retrograde menstruation, it is reasonable to assume that the endometrium is the source of these ovarian neoplasms. Finally, preliminary data suggest that mucinous and transitional (Brenner) tumors arise from transitional-type epithelial nests at the tubal-mesothelial junction by a process of metaplasia. Appreciation of these new concepts will allow for a more rationale approach to screening, treatment, and prevention that potentially can have a significant impact on reducing the mortality of this devastating disease.},

As a case study, on inducing {MSG} levels in a drug resistant breast cancer line resistance to anticancer drugs caerulomycin, camptothecin and topotecan decreased by more than 50–60\%, in both culture conditions and also in tumors generated in mice, in contrast to control un-induced cells.

Recent applications of {NMF} in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in {NMF} theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most {NMF} implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community.
{RESULTS}: Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard {NMF} algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new {NMF} methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/{BioConductor} platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published {NMF} algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new {NMF} strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The {NMF} package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications. Documentation, source code and sample data are available from {CRAN}.},

	abstract = {The human body contains several hundred cell types, all of which share the same genome. In metazoans, much of the regulatory code that drives cell type-specific gene expression is located in distal elements called enhancers. Although mammalian genomes contain millions of potential enhancers, only a small subset of them is active in a given cell type. Cell type-specific enhancer selection involves the binding of lineage-determining transcription factors that prime enhancers. Signal-dependent transcription factors bind to primed enhancers, which enables these broadly expressed factors to regulate gene expression in a cell type-specific manner. The expression of genes that specify cell type identity and function is associated with densely spaced clusters of active enhancers known as super-enhancers. The functions of enhancers and super-enhancers are influenced by, and affect, higher-order genomic organization.

	abstract = {The nucleolus is a nuclear organelle that coordinates {rRNA} transcription and ribosome subunit biogenesis. Recent proteomic analyses have shown that the nucleolus contains proteins involved in cell cycle control, {DNA} processing and {DNA} damage response and repair, in addition to the many proteins connected with ribosome subunit production. Here we study the dynamics of nucleolar protein responses in cells exposed to stress and {DNA} damage caused by ionizing and ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation in diploid human fibroblasts. We show using a combination of imaging and quantitative proteomics methods that nucleolar substructure and the nucleolar proteome undergo selective reorganization in response to {UV} damage. The proteomic responses to {UV} include alterations of functional protein complexes such as the {SSU} processome and exosome, and paraspeckle proteins, involving both decreases and increases in steady state protein ratios, respectively. Several nonhomologous end-joining proteins ({NHEJ}), such as Ku70/80, display similar fast responses to {UV}. In contrast, nucleolar proteomic responses to {IR} are both temporally and spatially distinct from those caused by {UV}, and more limited in terms of magnitude. With the exception of the {NHEJ} and paraspeckle proteins, where {IR} induces rapid and transient changes within 15 min of the damage, {IR} does not alter the ratios of most other functional nucleolar protein complexes. The rapid transient decrease of {NHEJ} proteins in the nucleolus indicates that it may reflect a response to {DNA} damage. Our results underline that the nucleolus is a specific stress response organelle that responds to different damage and stress agents in a unique, damage-specific manner.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ({SSRIs}) such as fluoxetine are the most common form of medication treatment for major depression. However, approximately 50\% of depressed patients fail to achieve an effective treatment response. Understanding how gene expression systems respond to treatments may be critical for understanding antidepressant resistance.
{METHODS}: We take a novel approach to this problem by demonstrating that the gene expression system of the dentate gyrus responds to fluoxetine ({FLX}), a commonly used antidepressant medication, in a stereotyped-manner involving changes in the expression levels of thousands of genes. The aggregate behavior of this large-scale systemic response was quantified with principal components analysis ({PCA}) yielding a single quantitative measure of the global gene expression system state.
{RESULTS}: Quantitative measures of system state were highly correlated with variability in levels of antidepressant-sensitive behaviors in a mouse model of depression treated with fluoxetine. Analysis of dorsal and ventral dentate samples in the same mice indicated that system state co-varied across these regions despite their reported functional differences. Aggregate measures of gene expression system state were very robust and remained unchanged when different microarray data processing algorithms were used and even when completely different sets of gene expression levels were used for their calculation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: System state measures provide a robust method to quantify and relate global gene expression system state variability to behavior and treatment. State variability also suggests that the diversity of reported changes in gene expression levels in response to treatments such as fluoxetine may represent different perspectives on unified but noisy global gene expression system state level responses. Studying regulation of gene expression systems at the state level may be useful in guiding new approaches to augmentation of traditional antidepressant treatments.},

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0017474},
	abstract = {Microarray experiments have been extensively used to define signatures, which are sets of genes that can be considered markers of experimental conditions (typically diseases). Paradoxically, in spite of the apparent functional role that might be attributed to such gene sets, signatures do not seem to be reproducible across experiments. Given the close relationship between function and protein interaction, network properties can be used to study to what extent signatures are composed of genes whose resulting proteins show a considerable level of interaction (and consequently a putative common functional role).

We have analysed 618 signatures and 507 modules of co-expression in cancer looking for significant values of four main protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) network parameters: connection degree, cluster coefficient, betweenness and number of components. A total of 3904 gene ontology ({GO}) modules, 146 {KEGG} pathways, and 263 Biocarta pathways have been used as functional modules of reference.

Co-expression modules found in microarray experiments display a high level of connectivity, similar to the one shown by conventional modules based on functional definitions ({GO}, {KEGG} and Biocarta). A general observation for all the classes studied is that the networks formed by the modules improve their topological parameters when an external protein is allowed to be introduced within the paths (up to the 70\% of {GO} modules show network parameters beyond the random expectation). This fact suggests that functional definitions are incomplete and some genes might still be missing. Conversely, signatures are clearly not capturing the altered functions in the corresponding studies. This is probably because the way in which the genes have been selected in the signatures is too conservative. These results suggest that gene selection methods which take into account relationships among genes should be superior to methods that assume independence among genes outside their functional contexts.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A wide variety of biological data can be modeled as network structures, including experimental results (e.g. protein-protein interactions), computational predictions (e.g. functional interaction networks), or curated structures (e.g. the Gene Ontology). While several tools exist for visualizing large graphs at a global level or small graphs in detail, previous systems have generally not allowed interactive analysis of dense networks containing thousands of vertices at a level of detail useful for biologists. Investigators often wish to explore specific portions of such networks from a detailed, gene-specific perspective, and balancing this requirement with the networks' large size, complex structure, and rich metadata is a substantial computational challenge. {RESULTS}: Graphle is an online interface to large collections of arbitrary undirected, weighted graphs, each possibly containing tens of thousands of vertices (e.g. genes) and hundreds of millions of edges (e.g. interactions). These are stored on a centralized server and accessed efficiently through an interactive Java applet. The Graphle applet allows a user to examine specific portions of a graph, retrieving the relevant neighborhood around a set of query vertices (genes). This neighborhood can then be refined and modified interactively, and the results can be saved either as publication-quality images or as raw data for further analysis. The Graphle web site currently includes several hundred biological networks representing predicted functional relationships from three heterogeneous data integration systems: S. cerevisiae data from {bioPIXIE}, E. coli data using {MEFIT}, and H. sapiens data from {HEFalMp}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Graphle serves as a search and visualization engine for biological networks, which can be managed locally (simplifying collaborative data sharing) and investigated remotely. The Graphle framework is freely downloadable and easily installed on new servers, allowing any lab to quickly set up a Graphle site from which their own biological network data can be shared online.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}

Copy number alterations ({CNAs}) associated with cancer are known to contribute to genomic instability and gene deregulation. Integrating {CNAs} with gene expression helps to elucidate the mechanisms by which {CNAs} act and to identify the transcriptional downstream targets of {CNAs}. Such analyses can help to sort functional driver events from the many accompanying passenger alterations. However, the way {CNAs} affect gene expression can vary in different cellular contexts, for example between different subtypes of the same cancer. Thus, it is important to develop computational approaches capable of inferring differential connectivity of regulatory networks in different cellular contexts.


{RESULTS}

We propose a statistical deregulation model that integrates copy number and expression data of different disease subtypes to jointly model common and differential regulatory relationships. Our model not only identifies {CNAs} driving gene expression changes, but at the same time also predicts differences in regulation that distinguish one cancer subtype from the other. We implement our model in a penalized regression framework and demonstrate in a simulation study the feasibility and accuracy of our approach. Subsequently, we show that this model can identify both known and novel aspects of cross-talk between the {ER} and {NOTCH} pathways in {ER}-negative-specific deregulations, when compared with {ER}-positive breast cancer. This flexible model can be applied on other modalities such as methylation or {microRNA} and expression to disentangle cancer signaling pathways.

Leveraging the existence of disease specific gene sets in {KEGG} and Metacore® databases, we compared the performance of sixteen methods under relaxed assumptions while using 42 real datasets (over 1,400 samples). Most of the methods ranked high the gene sets designed for specific diseases whenever samples from affected individuals were compared against controls via microarrays. The top methods for gene set prioritization were different from the top ones in terms of sensitivity, and four of the sixteen methods had large false positives rates assessed by permuting the phenotype of the samples. The best overall methods among those that generated reasonably low false positive rates, when permuting phenotypes, were {PLAGE}, {GLOBALTEST}, and {PADOG}. The best method in the category that generated higher than expected false positives was {MRGSE}.},

In addition, compared with exogenous synthetic {miRNAs}, these endogenous immune-related {miRNAs} are more resistant to relatively harsh conditions.

Contrary to this expectation, we find that they are in fact significantly overrepresented among the genes that have emerged during the early evolution of the metazoa. Using a phylostratigraphic approach, we have studied the evolutionary emergence of such genes at 19 phylogenetic levels. The majority of disease genes was already present in the eukaryotic ancestor, and the second largest number has arisen around the time of evolution of multicellularity. Conversely, genes specific to the mammalian lineage are highly underrepresented. Hence, genes involved in genetic diseases are not simply a random subset of all genes in the genome but are biased toward ancient genes.},

	abstract = {Most breast cancers expressing the estrogen receptor α ({ERα}) are treated successfully with the receptor antagonist tamoxifen ({TAM}), but many of these tumors recur. Elevated expression of the homeodomain transcription factor {HOXB}13 correlates with {TAM}-resistance in {ERα}-positive ({ER}+) breast cancer, but little is known regarding the underlying mechanism. Our comprehensive evaluation of {HOX} gene expression using tiling microarrays, with validation, showed that distant metastases from {TAM}-resistant patients also displayed high {HOXB}13 expression, suggesting a role for {HOXB}13 in tumor dissemination and survival. Here we show that {HOXB}13 confers {TAM} resistance by directly downregulating {ERα} transcription and protein expression. {HOXB}13 elevation promoted cell proliferation in vitro and growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Mechanistic investigations showed that {HOXB}13 transcriptionally upregulated interleukin ({IL})-6, activating the {mTOR} pathway via {STAT}3 phosphorylation to promote cell proliferation and fibroblast recruitment. Accordingly, {mTOR} inhibition suppressed fibroblast recruitment and proliferation of {HOXB}13-expressing {ER}+ breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts, alone or in combination with {TAM}. Taken together, our results establish a function for {HOXB}13 in {TAM} resistance through direct suppression of {ERα} and they identify the {IL}-6 pathways as mediator of disease progression and recurrence.},

The {MCF}-7 cell line was treated with 10 and 20\% breast cancer-associated {MSC} ({BC}-{MSC})-conditioned medium ({CM}) for 10-48 h, and changes in proliferation and migration were observed. Furthermore, we investigated the migration of 10 and 20\% {CM} concentrations on {MCF}-7 through a scratch wound assay and a transwell migration assay. We successfully isolated and identified {MSCs} from primary breast cancer tissues. {BC}-{MSCs} showed characteristics similar to those of bone marrow {MSCs}, and possessed the capability of multipotential differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes. The results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ({MTT}) assay showed that 10 and 20\% {CM} concentrations increased the proliferation of {MCF}-7 cells to different levels. The results also revealed a greater increase in different levels compared with the control group. In conclusion, {MSCs} were confirmed to exist in human breast cancer tissues, and {BC}-{MSCs} may promote the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells.},

Cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) make up the bulk of cancer stroma and affect the tumor microenvironment such that they promote cancer initiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. In breast cancer, {CAFs} not only promote tumor progression but also induce therapeutic resistance. Accordingly, targeting {CAFs} provides a novel way to control tumors with therapeutic resistance. This review summarizes the current understandings of tumor stroma in breast cancer with a particular emphasis on the role of {CAFs} and the therapeutic implications of {CAFs}. In addition, the effects of other stromal components such as endothelial cells, macrophages, and adipocytes in breast cancer are also discussed.

	abstract = {Macroautophagy (referred to hereafter as autophagy) is a highly regulated cellular process that serves to remove damaged proteins and organelles from the cell. Autophagy contributes to an array of normal and pathological processes, and has recently emerged as a key regulator of multiple aspects of cancer biology. The role of autophagy in cancer is complex and is likely dependent on tumor type, stage, and genetic context. This complexity is illustrated by the identification of settings where autophagy acts potently to either promote or inhibit tumorigenesis. In this review, I discuss the underlying basis for these opposing functions and propose a model suggesting a dynamic role for autophagy in malignancy. Collectively, the data point to autophagy as serving as a barrier to limit tumor initiation. Once neoplastic lesions are established, it appears that adaptive changes occur that now result in positive roles for autophagy in malignant progression and in subsequent tumor maintenance. Remarkably, constitutive activation of autophagy is critical for continued growth of some tumors, serving to both reduce oxidative stress and provide key intermediates to sustain cell metabolism. Autophagy is also induced in response to cancer therapies where it can function as a survival mechanism that limits drug efficacy. These findings have inspired significant interest in applying anti-autophagy therapies as an entirely new approach to cancer treatment. It is now apparent that aberrant control of autophagy is among the key hallmarks of cancer. While much needs to be learned about the regulation and context-dependent biological functions of autophagy, it seems clear that modulation of this process will be an attractive avenue for future cancer therapeutic approaches.},

While the fact that sequence similarity implies functional similarity is a fundamental paradigm of molecular biology, sequence comparison does not directly assess the extent to which two proteins participate in the same biological processes, and has limited utility for analyzing families with several parologous members. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to provide a cross-organism functional similarity measure in an unbiased way through the exclusive use of high-throughput gene-expression data. Our methodology is based on probabilistic cross-species mapping of functionally analogous proteins based on Bayesian integrative analysis of gene expression compendia. We demonstrate that even among closely related genes, our method is able to predict functionally analogous homolog pairs better than relying on sequence comparison alone. We also demonstrate that the landscape of functional similarity is often complex and that definitive "functional orthologs" do not always exist. Even in these cases, our method and the online interface we provide are designed to allow detailed exploration of sources of inferred functional similarity that can be evaluated by the user.},

{OBJECTIVE}: To analyze data and current trends in immune checkpoint targeting therapy for urologic cancers.
{EVIDENCE} {ACQUISITION}: Systematic literature search for clinical trials in the {PubMed} and Cochrane databases up to August 2014 according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Endpoints included oncologic results, tumor response rates, safety, and tolerability.
{EVIDENCE} {SYNTHESIS}: Anti-{CTLA}-4 monotherapy has demonstrated biochemical responses in prostate cancer. One phase 3 trial assessing ipilimumab efficacy in castration-resistant disease was negative overall. Nevertheless, ipilimumab may significantly improve overall survival compared with placebo in subgroups of patients with favorable prognostic features. In renal cancer, phase 1 trials showed interesting stabilization or long-lasting objective response rates approaching 50\% using anti-{PD}-1/{PD}-L1 drugs in heavily pretreated metastatic patients. In bladder cancer, one phase 2 trial indicated a good safety profile for ipilimumab as a neoadjuvant drug before radical cystectomy. Overall, immune-related effects such as colitis and dermatitis were common and well tolerated.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our systematic review shows that antibodies blocking immune checkpoints offer interesting and long-lasting response rates in heavily pretreated patients with advanced urologic cancers. More promising results are currently provided by anti-{CTLA}-4 antibodies in prostate cancer and by {PD}-1/{PD}-L1 inhibitors in renal cancer. These should encourage new clinical trials of immune therapy combinations and immunotherapy monotherapy combined with conventional anticancer drugs. In bladder cancer, the use of targeted immunotherapy still remains underevaluated; however, preliminary results reported at recent conferences seem encouraging.
{PATIENT} {SUMMARY}: Data from studies support the activity and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors in urologic cancers, alone or in combination with conventional cancer therapies. Encouraging data in other oncologic fields could translate into interesting responses in urological cancers.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The normal functioning of a living cell is characterized by complex interaction networks involving many different types of molecules. Associations detected between diseases and perturbations in well-defined pathways within such interaction networks have the potential to illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and response to treatment.


{RESULTS}

In this paper, we present a computational method that compares expression profiles of genes in cancer samples to samples from normal tissues in order to detect perturbations of pre-defined pathways in the cancer. In contrast to many previous methods, our scoring function approach explicitly takes into account the interactions between the gene products in a pathway. Moreover, we compute the sub-pathway that has the highest score, as opposed to merely computing the score for the entire pathway. We use a permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the most perturbed sub-pathway. We apply our method to 20 pathways in the Netpath database and to the Global Cancer Map of gene expression in 18 cancers. We demonstrate that our method yields more sensitive results than alternatives that do not consider interactions or measure the perturbation of a pathway as a whole. We perform a sensitivity analysis to show that our approach is robust to modest changes in the input data. Our method confirms numerous well-known connections between pathways and cancers.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our results indicate that integrating differential gene expression with the interaction structure in a pathway is a powerful approach for detecting links between a cancer and the pathways perturbed in it. Our results also suggest that even well-studied pathways may be perturbed only partially in any given cancer. Further analysis of cancer-specific sub-pathways may shed new light on the similarities and differences between cancers.},

Here we demonstrated that the p53 family member p63 controls a pathway for p73-dependent cisplatin sensitivity specific to these "triple-negative" tumors. In vivo, {DeltaNp}63 and {TAp}73 isoforms were coexpressed exclusively within a subset of triple-negative primary breast cancers that commonly exhibited mutational inactivation of p53. The {DeltaNp}63alpha isoform promoted survival of breast cancer cells by binding {TAp}73 and thereby inhibiting its proapoptotic activity. Consequently, inhibition of p63 by {RNA} interference led to {TAp}73-dependent induction of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and apoptosis. Breast cancer cells expressing {DeltaNp}63alpha and {TAp}73 exhibited cisplatin sensitivity that was uniquely dependent on {TAp}73. Thus, in response to treatment with cisplatin, but not other chemotherapeutic agents, {TAp}73 underwent c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation, which promoted dissociation of the {DeltaNp}63alpha/{TAp}73 protein complex, {TAp}73-dependent transcription of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and apoptosis. These findings define p63 as a survival factor in a subset of breast cancers; furthermore, they provide what we believe to be a novel mechanism for cisplatin sensitivity in these triple-negative cancers, and they suggest that such cancers may share the cisplatin sensitivity of {BRCA}1-associated tumors.},

	abstract = {Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are critical processes in fetal circulation and placental vasculature development. Placental mesenchymal stem cells ({pMSC}) are known to release paracrine factors (some of which are contained within exosomes) that promote angiogenesis and cell migration. The aims of this study were: to determine the effects of oxygen tension on the release of exosomes from {pMSC}; and to establish the effects of {pMSC}-derived exosomes on the migration and angiogenic tube formation of placental microvascular endothelial cells ({hPMEC}). {pMSC} were isolated from placental villi (8–12 weeks of gestation, n = 6) and cultured under an atmosphere of 1\%, 3\% or 8\% O2. Cell-conditioned media were collected and exosomes (exo-{pMSC}) isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. The dose effect (5–20 µg exosomal protein/ml) of {pMSC}-derived exosomes on {hPMEC} migration and tube formation were established using a real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™). The exosome pellet was resuspended in {PBS} and protein content was established by mass spectrometry ({MS}). Protein function and canonical pathways were identified using the {PANTHER} program and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, respectively. Exo-{pMSC} were identified, by electron microscopy, as spherical vesicles, with a typical cup-shape and diameters around of 100 nm and positive for exosome markers: {CD}63, {CD}9 and {CD}81. Under hypoxic conditions (1\% and 3\% O2) exo-{pMSC} released increased by 3.3 and 6.7 folds, respectively, when compared to the controls (8\% O2; p{\textless}0.01). Exo-{pMSC} increased {hPMEC} migration by 1.6 fold compared to the control (p{\textless}0.05) and increased {hPMEC} tube formation by 7.2 fold (p{\textless}0.05). {MS} analysis identified 390 different proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, development, immunomodulatory, and cell-to-cell communication. The data obtained support the hypothesis that {pMSC}-derived exosomes may contribute to placental vascular adaptation to low oxygen tension under both physiological and pathological conditions.},

Weight gain during adolescence carries a higher risk for adult obesity and the metabolic syndrome. This review highlights early adolescence as a particularly high-risk time for weight gain due to the synergy of naturally occurring metabolic changes along with increasing behavioral risk factors. One of the first potential health effects of abnormal weight gain during this period is earlier puberty, usually manifested as thelarche. The obesity epidemic is clearly implicated in the national trend toward earlier thelarche, although the data are not as strong in relation to menarche. Leptin activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, combined with insulin resistance, and increased adiposity may result in the higher estrogen levels that are linked to breast development. Young adolescents also experience a sharp decline in their level of physical activity, worsening nutritional habits, and other important psychosocial and developmental risk factors that may contribute to obesity and estrogen-dependent disease in later life, including polycystic ovary syndrome and breast cancer. Unfortunately, the very psychosocial factors that contribute to abnormal weight gain during early adolescence make prevention and treatment in this population particularly challenging. Therefore, intervening prior to pubertal onset becomes even more important given the risk factors present once puberty begins.},

Several studies suggested that chromatin regulators have a key role in generating expression diversity, predicting a reduction in the interspecies differences on deletion of genes that influence chromatin structure or modifications. To examine this, we compared the genome-wide expression profiles of two closely related yeast species following the individual deletions of eight chromatin regulators and one transcription factor. In all cases, regulator deletions increased, rather than decreased, the expression differences between the species, revealing hidden genetic variability that was masked in the wild-type backgrounds. This effect was not observed for individual deletions of 11 enzymes involved in central metabolic pathways. The buffered variations were associated with trans differences, as revealed by allele-specific profiling of the interspecific hybrids. Our results support the idea that regulatory proteins serve as capacitors that buffer gene expression against hidden genetic variability.},

	shorttitle = {Embryonic stem cell {microRNAs}},
	abstract = {The discovery of {microRNAs} ({miRNAs} - small non-coding {RNAs} of approximately 22 nt) heralded a new and exciting era in biology. During this period {miRNAs} have gone from ignominy due to their origin mainly in 'junk {DNA}' to notoriety where they can be at once characterized as being all powerful (a single {miRNA} can target and potentially silence several hundred genes) and yet marginal (a given gene can be targeted by several {miRNAs} such that a given {miRNA} typically exerts a modest repression) [1-4]. The emerging paradox is exemplified by {miRNAs} that are prominently expressed in embryonic stem ({ES}) cells. The collective importance of {miRNAs} is firmly established by the fact that Dicer-/- mouse embryos die on day 7.5 due to defects in differentiation [5]. However, oppositely correlated expression that is expected of conventional repressors is increasingly being defied in multiple systems in relation to {miRNA}-{mRNA} target pairs. This is most evident in {ES} cells where {miR}-290-295 and 302 clusters the most abundant {ES} cell {miRNAs} are found to be driven by pluripotency genes Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 and also target these genes in 'incoherent feed-forward loops' [7]. Here the {miRNAs} are co-expressed and positively correlated with these targets that they repress suggesting that one of their primary roles is to fine tune gene expression rather than act as {ON}/{OFF} switches. On the other hand, let-7 family members that are notably low in {ES} cells and rapidly induced upon differentiation exhibit more conventional anti-correlated expression patterns with their targets [7-8]. In an intricately designed auto-regulatory loop, {LIN}28, a key 'keeper' of the pluripotent state binds and represses the processing of let-7 (a key 'keeper' of the differentiated state) [9-11]. One of the let-7 family members, let-7g targets and represses {LIN}28 through four 3'-{UTR} binding sites [12]. We propose that {LIN}28/let-7 pair has the potential to act as a 'toggle switch' that balances the decision to maintain pluripotency vs. differentiation. We also propose that the c-Myc/E2F driven {miR}17-92 cluster that together controls the G1 to S transition is fundamental for {ES} self-renewal and cell proliferation [13-18]. In that context it is no surprise that {LIN}28 and c-Myc (and therefore let-7 and {miR}-17-92 by association) and more recently Oct4/Sox2 regulated {miR}-302 has been shown to be among a handful of factors shown to be necessary and sufficient to convert differentiated cells to induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cells [19-29]. It is also no surprise that activation of {miR}-17-92 ({OncomiRs}) and down-regulation of let-7 (tumor suppressors) is a recurring theme in relation to cancers from multiple systems [30-48]. We speculate that the {LIN}28/let-7; c-{MYC}-E2F/{miR}-17-92 and Oct4/Sox2/{miR}-302-cyclin D1 networks are fundamental to properties of pluripotency and self-renewal associated with embryonic stem cells. We also speculate that {ES} cell {miRNA}-{mRNA} associations may also regulate tissue homeostasis and regeneration in the fully developed adult. Consequently, the appropriate regulation of {LIN}28/let-7; c-{MYC}-E2F/{miR}-17-92 and Oct4/Sox2/{miR}-302-cyclin D1 gene networks will be critical for the success of regenerative strategies that involve {iPS} cells. Any perturbation in key {ES} cell {miRNA}-{mRNA} networks during any of the above processes maybe a hallmark of ({CSCs}).},

More than half of all human promoters contain {CpG} islands with a tissue-specific methylation pattern in differentiated cells. Still today, the whole process of how {DNA} methyltransferases determine which region should be methylated is not completely revealed. There are many hypotheses of which genomic features are correlated to the epigenome that have not yet been evaluated. Furthermore, many explorative approaches of measuring {DNA} methylation are limited to a subset of the genome and thus, cannot be employed, e.g., for genome-wide biomarker prediction methods. In this study, we evaluated the correlation of genetic, epigenetic and hypothesis-driven features to {DNA} methylation of {CpG} islands. To this end, various binary classifiers were trained and evaluated by cross-validation on a dataset comprising {DNA} methylation data for 190 {CpG} islands in {HEPG}2, {HEK}293, fibroblasts and leukocytes. We achieved an accuracy of up to 91\% with an {MCC} of 0.8 using ten-fold cross-validation and ten repetitions. With these models, we extended the existing dataset to the whole genome and thus, predicted the methylation landscape for the given cell types. The method used for these predictions is also validated on another external whole-genome dataset. Our results reveal features correlated to {DNA} methylation and confirm or disprove various hypotheses of {DNA} methylation related features. This study confirms correlations between {DNA} methylation and histone modifications, {DNA} structure, {DNA} sequence, genomic attributes and {CpG} island properties. Furthermore, the method has been validated on a genome-wide dataset from the {ENCODE} consortium.

	doi = {10.1186/1755-8794-4-54},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Genomic tests are available to predict breast cancer recurrence and to guide clinical decision making. These predictors provide recurrence risk scores along with a measure of uncertainty, usually a confidence interval. The confidence interval conveys random error and not systematic bias. Standard tumor sampling methods make this problematic, as it is common to have a substantial proportion (typically 30-50\%) of a tumor sample comprised of histologically benign tissue. This "normal" tissue could represent a source of non-random error or systematic bias in genomic classification.
{METHODS}: To assess the performance characteristics of genomic classification to systematic error from normal contamination, we collected 55 tumor samples and paired tumor-adjacent normal tissue. Using genomic signatures from the tumor and paired normal, we evaluated how increasing normal contamination altered recurrence risk scores for various genomic predictors.
{RESULTS}: Simulations of normal tissue contamination caused misclassification of tumors in all predictors evaluated, but different breast cancer predictors showed different types of vulnerability to normal tissue bias. While two predictors had unpredictable direction of bias (either higher or lower risk of relapse resulted from normal contamination), one signature showed predictable direction of normal tissue effects. Due to this predictable direction of effect, this signature (the {PAM}50) was adjusted for normal tissue contamination and these corrections improved sensitivity and negative predictive value. For all three assays quality control standards and/or appropriate bias adjustment strategies can be used to improve assay reliability.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Normal tissue sampled concurrently with tumor is an important source of bias in breast genomic predictors. All genomic predictors show some sensitivity to normal tissue contamination and ideal strategies for mitigating this bias vary depending upon the particular genes and computational methods used in the predictor.},

	abstract = {Acquired resistance to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen remains a significant challenge in breast cancer management. In this study, we used an integrative approach to characterize global protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation events in tamoxifen-resistant {MCF}7 breast cancer cells ({TamR}) compared with parental controls. Quantitative mass spectrometry and computational approaches were combined to identify perturbed signalling networks, and candidate regulatory proteins were functionally interrogated by {siRNA}-mediated knockdown. Network analysis revealed that cellular metabolism was perturbed in {TamR} cells, together with pathways enriched for proteins associated with growth factor, cell-cell and cell matrix-initiated signalling. Consistent with known roles for Ras/{MAPK} and {PI}3-kinase signalling in tamoxifen resistance, tyrosine-phosphorylated {MAPK}1, {SHC}1 and {PIK}3R2 were elevated in {TamR} cells. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase Yes and expression of the actin-binding protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate ({MARCKS}) were increased two- and eightfold in {TamR} cells respectively, and these proteins were selected for further analysis. Knockdown of either protein in {TamR} cells had no effect on anti-estrogen sensitivity, but significantly decreased cell motility. {MARCKS} expression was significantly higher in breast cancer cell lines than normal mammary epithelial cells and in {ER}-negative versus {ER}-positive breast cancer cell lines. In primary breast cancers, cytoplasmic {MARCKS} staining was significantly higher in basal-like and {HER}2 cancers than in luminal cancers, and was independently predictive of poor survival in multivariate analyses of the whole cohort (P {\textless} 0.0001) and in {ER}-positive patients (P = 0.0005). These findings provide network-level insights into the molecular alterations associated with the tamoxifen-resistant phenotype, and identify {MARCKS} as a potential biomarker of therapeutic responsiveness that may assist in stratification of patients for optimal therapy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Despite initial response in adjuvant chemotherapy, ovarian cancer patients treated with the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin frequently suffer from recurrence after few cycles of treatment, and the underlying mechanisms causing the chemoresistance remain unclear. Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) research network concluded an ovarian cancer study and released the dataset to the public. The {TCGA} dataset possesses large sample size, comprehensive molecular profiles, and clinical outcome information; however, because of the unknown molecular subtypes in ovarian cancer and the great diversity of adjuvant treatments {TCGA} patients went through, studying chemotherapeutic response using the {TCGA} data is difficult. Additionally, factors such as sample batches, patient ages, and tumor stages further confound or suppress the identification of relevant genes, and thus the biological functions and disease mechanisms.
{RESULTS}: To address these issues, herein we propose an analysis procedure designed to reduce suppression effect by focusing on a specific chemotherapeutic treatment, and to remove confounding effects such as batch effect, patient's age, and tumor stages. The proposed procedure starts with a batch effect adjustment, followed by a rigorous sample selection process. Then, the gene expression, copy number, and methylation profiles from the {TCGA} ovarian cancer dataset are analyzed using a semi-supervised clustering method combined with a novel scoring function. As a result, two molecular classifications, one with poor copy number profiles and one with poor methylation profiles, enriched with unfavorable scores are identified. Compared with the samples enriched with favorable scores, these two classifications exhibit poor progression-free survival ({PFS}) and might be associated with poor chemotherapy response specifically to the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Significant genes and biological processes are detected subsequently using classical statistical approaches and enrichment analysis.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The proposed procedure for the reduction of confounding and suppression effects and the semi-supervised clustering method are essential steps to identify genes associated with the chemotherapeutic response.},

The determination of a robust signature that predicts chemo-response could lead to the identification of molecular markers for response as well as possible clinical implementation in the future to identify patients at risk of failing therapy. This pilot study was designed to identify biological processes affecting candidate pathways associated with chemo-response and to create a robust gene signature for follow-up studies. After identifying common pathways associated with chemo-response in serous {OVCA} in 3 independent gene expression experiments, we assessed the biological processes associated with them using The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) dataset for serous {OVCA}. We identified differential copy number alterations ({CNA}), mutations, {DNA} methylation, and {miRNA} expression between patients that responded to standard treatment and those who did not or recurred prematurely. We correlated these significant parameters to gene expression to create a signature of 422 genes associated with chemo-response. A consensus clustering of this signature identified 2 differentiated clusters with unique molecular patterns: cluster \#1 was significant for cellular signaling and immune response (mainly cell-mediated); and cluster \#2 was significant for pathways involving {DNA} damage repair and replication, cell cycle and apoptosis. Validation through consensus clustering was performed in 5 independent {OVCA} gene expression experiments. Genes were located in the same cluster with consistent agreement in all 5 studies (Kappa coefficient ≥ 0.6 in 4). Integrating high throughput biological data has created a robust molecular signature that predicts chemo-response in {OVCA}.},

However, responses to targeted anti-angiogenic therapies have been reported to vary among patients. This suggests that the tumor vasculature may be heterogeneous and that an appropriate choice of treatment would require an understanding of these differences. {METHODS}: In order to investigate whether and how the breast tumor vasculature varies between individuals, we have isolated tumor-associated and matched normal vasculature from 17 breast carcinomas by laser capture microdissection, and generated gene expression profiles. Since microvessel density has previously been associated with disease course, tumors with low (n=9) or high (n=8) microvessel density were selected for analysis to maximize heterogeneity for this feature. {RESULTS}: We identify differences between tumor and normal vasculature, and describe two subtypes present within tumor vasculature. These subtypes exhibit distinct gene expression signatures that reflect features including hallmarks of vessel maturity. Potential therapeutic targets ({MET}, {ITGAV} and {PDGFR}) are differentially expressed between subtypes. Taking these subtypes into account has allowed us to derive a vascular signature associated with disease outcome. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results further support a role for tumor microvasculature in determining disease progression. Overall, this study provides a deeper molecular understanding of the heterogeneity existing within the breast tumor vasculature, and opens new avenues towards the improved design and targeting of anti-angiogenic therapies.},

	doi = {10.1186/1752-0509-7-S2-S4},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer is an important step for the effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. With the huge volume of data from the large-scale cancer genomics projects, an open challenge is to distinguish driver mutations, pathways, and gene sets (or core modules) that contribute to cancer formation and progression from random passengers which accumulate in somatic cells but do not contribute to tumorigenesis. Due to mutational heterogeneity, current analyses are often restricted to known pathways and functional modules for enrichment of somatic mutations. Therefore, discovery of new pathways and functional modules is a pressing need.
{RESULTS}: In this study, we propose a novel method to identify Mutated Core Modules in Cancer ({iMCMC}) without any prior information other than cancer genomic data from patients with tumors. This is a network-based approach in which three kinds of data are integrated: somatic mutations, copy number variations ({CNVs}), and gene expressions. Firstly, the first two datasets are merged to obtain a mutation matrix, based on which a weighted mutation network is constructed where the vertex weight corresponds to gene coverage and the edge weight corresponds to the mutual exclusivity between gene pairs. Similarly, a weighted expression network is generated from the expression matrix where the vertex and edge weights correspond to the influence of a gene mutation on other genes and the Pearson correlation of gene mutation-correlated expressions, respectively. Then an integrative network is obtained by further combining these two networks, and the most coherent subnetworks are identified by using an optimization model. Finally, we obtained the core modules for tumors by filtering with significance and exclusivity tests. We applied {iMCMC} to the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}) and ovarian carcinoma data, and identified several mutated core modules, some of which are involved in known pathways. Most of the implicated genes are oncogenes or tumor suppressors previously reported to be related to carcinogenesis. As a comparison, we also performed {iMCMC} on two of the three kinds of data, i.e., the datasets combining somatic mutations with {CNVs} and secondly the datasets combining somatic mutations with gene expressions. The results indicate that gene expressions or {CNVs} indeed provide extra useful information to the original data for the identification of core modules in cancer.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study demonstrates the utility of our {iMCMC} by integrating multiple data sources to identify mutated core modules in cancer. In addition to presenting a generally applicable methodology, our findings provide several candidate pathways or core modules recurrently perturbed in {GBM} or ovarian carcinoma for further studies.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: High-grade serous cancer ({HGSC}) is the most common cancer of the ovary and is characterized by chromosomal instability. Defects in homologous recombination repair ({HRR}) are associated with genomic instability in {HGSC}, and are exploited by therapy targeting {DNA} repair. Defective {HRR} causes uniparental deletions and loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}). Our purpose is to profile {LOH} in {HGSC} and correlate our findings to clinical outcome, and compare {HGSC} and high-grade breast cancers.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We examined {LOH} and copy number changes using single nucleotide polymorphism array data from three {HGSC} cohorts and compared results to a cohort of high-grade breast cancers. The {LOH} profiles in {HGSC} were matched to chemotherapy resistance and progression-free survival ({PFS}).
{RESULTS}: {LOH}-based clustering divided {HGSC} into two clusters. The major group displayed extensive {LOH} and was further divided into two subgroups. The second group contained remarkably less {LOH}. {BRCA}1 promoter methylation was associated with the major group. {LOH} clusters were reproducible when validated in two independent {HGSC} datasets. {LOH} burden in the major cluster of {HGSC} was similar to triple-negative, and distinct from other high-grade breast cancers. Our analysis revealed an {LOH} cluster with lower treatment resistance and a significant correlation between {LOH} burden and {PFS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Separating {HGSC} by {LOH}-based clustering produces remarkably stable subgroups in three different cohorts. Patients in the various {LOH} clusters differed with respect to chemotherapy resistance, and the extent of {LOH} correlated with {PFS}. {LOH} burden may indicate vulnerability to treatment targeting {DNA} repair, such as {PARP}1 inhibitors.},

In this report we use microarray and proteomic analyses to identify transcriptomic and proteomic alterations affecting cardioprotection using cold blood cardioplegia in the mature and aged male and female heart. Mature and aged male and female New Zealand White rabbits were used for in situ blood perfused cardiopulmonary bypass. Control hearts received 30 min sham ischemia and 120 min sham reperfusion. Global ischemia ({GI}) hearts received 30 min of {GI} achieved by cross-clamping of the aorta. Cardioplegia ({CP}) hearts received cold blood cardioplegia prior to {GI}. Following 30 min of {GI} the hearts were reperfused for 120 min and then used for {RNA} and protein isolation. Microarray and proteomic analyses were performed. Functional enrichment analysis showed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation and calcium signaling pathways were significantly enriched in all experimental groups. Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway were significantly changed in the aged male only (P {\textless} 0.05), while glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism was significant in the aged female only (P {\textless} 0.05). Our data show that specific pathways associated with the mitochondrion modulate cardioprotection with {CP} in the aged and specifically in the aged female. The alteration of these pathways significantly contributes to decreased myocardial functional recovery and myonecrosis following ischemia and may be modulated to allow for enhanced cardioprotection in the aged and specifically in the aged female.},

	abstract = {Microarrays were one of the first technologies of the genomic revolution to gain widespread adoption, rapidly expanding from a cottage industry to the source of thousands of experimental results. They were one of the first assays for which data repositories and metadata were standardized and researchers were required by many journals to make published data publicly available. Microarrays provide high-throughput insights into the biological functions of genes and gene products; however, they also present a "curse of dimensionality," whereby the availability of many gene expression measurements in few samples make it challenging to distinguish noise from true biological signal. All of these factors argue for integrative approaches to microarray data analysis, which combine data from multiple experiments to increase sample size, avoid laboratory-specific bias, and enable new biological insights not possible from a single experiment. Here, we discuss several approaches to integrative microarray analysis for a diverse range of applications, including biomarker discovery, gene function and interaction prediction, and regulatory network inference. We also show how, by integrating large microarray compendia with diverse genomic data types, more nuanced biological hypotheses can be explored computationally. This chapter provides overviews and brief descriptions of each of these approaches to microarray integration.},

A prominent, outstanding problem in {RNA}-seq is how to estimate transcript abundances in heterogeneous tissues, where a sample is composed of more than one cell type and the inhomogeneity can substantially confound the transcript abundance estimation of each individual cell type. Although experimental methods have been proposed to dissect multiple distinct cell types, computationally "deconvoluting" heterogeneous tissues provides an attractive alternative, since it keeps the tissue sample as well as the subsequent molecular content yield intact.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Recently we have witnessed a surge of interest in using genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) to discover the genetic basis of complex diseases. Many genetic variations, mostly in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), have been identified in a wide spectrum of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and psychiatric diseases. A common theme arising from these studies is that the genetic variations discovered by {GWAS} can only explain a small fraction of the genetic risks associated with the complex diseases. New strategies and statistical approaches are needed to address this lack of explanation. One such approach is the pathway analysis, which considers the genetic variations underlying a biological pathway, rather than separately as in the traditional {GWAS} studies. A critical challenge in the pathway analysis is how to combine evidences of association over multiple {SNPs} within a gene and multiple genes within a pathway. Most current methods choose the most significant {SNP} from each gene as a representative, ignoring the joint action of multiple {SNPs} within a gene. This approach leads to preferential identification of genes with a greater number of {SNPs}.


{RESULTS}

We describe a {SNP}-based pathway enrichment method for {GWAS} studies. The method consists of the following two main steps: 1) for a given pathway, using an adaptive truncated product statistic to identify all representative (potentially more than one) {SNPs} of each gene, calculating the average number of representative {SNPs} for the genes, then re-selecting the representative {SNPs} of genes in the pathway based on this number; and 2) ranking all selected {SNPs} by the significance of their statistical association with a trait of interest, and testing if the set of {SNPs} from a particular pathway is significantly enriched with high ranks using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We applied our method to two large genetically distinct {GWAS} data sets of schizophrenia, one from European-American ({EA}) and the other from African-American ({AA}). In the {EA} data set, we found 22 pathways with nominal P-value less than or equal to 0.001 and corresponding false discovery rate ({FDR}) less than 5\%. In the {AA} data set, we found 11 pathways by controlling the same nominal P-value and {FDR} threshold. Interestingly, 8 of these pathways overlap with those found in the {EA} sample. We have implemented our method in a {JAVA} software package, called {SNP} Set Enrichment Analysis ({SSEA}), which contains a user-friendly interface and is freely available at http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/{SSEA}.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The {SNP}-based pathway enrichment method described here offers a new alternative approach for analysing {GWAS} data. By applying it to schizophrenia {GWAS} studies, we show that our method is able to identify statistically significant pathways, and importantly, pathways that can be replicated in large genetically distinct samples.},

	abstract = {This study reports an unusual ploidy-specific response to replication stress presented by a defective minichromosome maintenance ({MCM}) helicase allele in yeast. The corresponding mouse allele, Mcm4Chaos3, predisposes mice to mammary gland tumors. While mcm4Chaos3 causes replication stress in both haploid and diploid yeast, only diploid mutants exhibit G2/M delay, severe genetic instability ({GIN}), and reduced viability. These different outcomes are associated with distinct repair pathways adopted in haploid and diploid mutants. Haploid mutants use the Rad6-dependent pathways that resume stalled forks, whereas the diploid mutants use the Rad52- and {MRX}-dependent pathways that repair double strand breaks. The repair pathway choice is irreversible and not regulated by the availability of repair enzymes. This ploidy effect is independent of mating type heterozygosity and not further enhanced by increasing ploidy. In summary, a defective {MCM} helicase causes {GIN} only in particular cell types. In response to replication stress, early events associated with ploidy dictate the repair pathway choice. This study uncovers a fundamental difference between haplophase and diplophase in the maintenance of genome integrity.
Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by cohesin ensures proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Cohesin is also required for postreplicative {DNA} double-strand break repair and gene expression. The molecular mechanisms of these diverse cohesin functions remain to be elucidated. Here we report that the cohesin subunits Scc3 and Smc1 are both required for the production of the meiosis-specific subunit Rec8 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a genetic approach, we depleted Scc3 and Smc1 independently in cells that were undergoing meiosis. Both Scc3- and Smc1-depleted cells were inducible for meiosis, but the {REC}8 promoter was only marginally activated, leading to reduced levels of {REC}8 transcription and protein production. In contrast, the expression of {MCD}1, the mitotic counterpart of {REC}8, was not subject to Scc3 regulation in vegetative cells. We provide genetic evidence to show that sister-chromatid cohesion is not necessary for activation of {REC}8 gene expression. Cohesin appears to positively regulate the expression of a variety of genes during yeast meiosis. Our results suggest that the cohesin complex plays a dual role in gene regulation and sister-chromatid cohesion during meiotic differentiation in yeast.},

	abstract = {The field of exosome research is rapidly expanding, with a dramatic increase in publications in recent years. These small vesicles (30-100 nm) of endocytic origin were first proposed to function as a way for reticulocytes to eradicate the transferrin receptor while maturing into erythrocytes, and were later named exosomes. Exosomes are formed by inward budding of late endosomes, producing multivesicular bodies ({MVBs}), and are released into the environment by fusion of the {MVBs} with the plasma membrane. Since the first discovery of exosomes, a wide range of cells have been shown to release these vesicles. Exosomes have also been detected in several biological fluids, including plasma, nasal lavage fluid, saliva and breast milk. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the content and function of exosomes depends on the originating cell and the conditions under which they are produced. A variety of functions have been demonstrated for exosomes, such as induction of tolerance against allergen, eradication of established tumors in mice, inhibition and activation of natural killer cells, promotion of differentiation into T regulatory cells, stimulation of T cell proliferation and induction of T cell apoptosis. Year 2007 we demonstrated that exosomes released from mast cells contain messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) and {microRNA} ({miRNA}), and that the {RNA} can be shuttled from one cell to another via exosomes. In the recipient cells, the {mRNA} shuttled by exosomes was shown to be translated into protein, suggesting a regulatory function of the transferred {RNA}. Further, we have also shown that exosomes derived from cells grown under oxidative stress can induce tolerance against further stress in recipient cells and thus suggest a biological function of the exosomal shuttle {RNA}. Cell culture media and biological fluids contain a mixture of vesicles and shed fragments. A high quality isolation method for exosomes, followed by characterization and identification of the exosomes and their content, is therefore crucial to distinguish exosomes from other vesicles and particles. Here, we present a method for the isolation of exosomes from both cell culture medium and body fluids. This isolation method is based on repeated centrifugation and filtration steps, followed by a final ultracentrifugation step in which the exosomes are pelleted. Important methods to identify the exosomes and characterize the exosomal morphology and protein content are highlighted, including electron microscopy, flow cytometry and Western blot. The purification of the total exosomal {RNA} is based on spin column chromatography and the exosomal {RNA} yield and size distribution is analyzed using a Bioanalyzer.},

Two common approaches summarize each dose-response curve with either the {IC}50 or the slope parameter estimates from a hill slope fit and treat these estimates as the response in a linear model. The current study investigates these two methods, as well as four novel methods, and compares their power to detect differences between the response profiles of genotypes under a variety of different alternatives. The four novel methods include two methods that summarize each dose-response by its area under the curve, one method based off of an analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) design, and one method that compares hill slope fits for all individuals of each genotype. The power of each method was found to depend not only on the choice of alternative, but also on the choice for the set of dosages used in cytotoxicity measurements. The {ANOVA}-based method was found to be the most robust across alternatives and dosage sets for power in detecting differences between genotypes.},

	abstract = {Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ({HIPEC}) has shown promise in treatment of ovarian carcinosis. Despite its efficiency for the treatment of peritoneal carcinosis from digestive tract neoplasia, it has failed to demonstrate significant benefit in ovarian cancers. It is therefore essential to understand the mechanism underlying resistance to {HIPEC} in ovarian cancers. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSC}) play an important role in the development of ovarian cancer metastasis and resistance to treatments. A recent study suggests that {MSCs} may be cytotoxic for cancer cells upon heat shock. In contrast, we describe the protective role of {MSC} against hyperthermia. Using cytokine arrays we determined that the tumor associated {MSC} ({TAMC}) secrete pro-tumoral cytokines. We studied the effect of hyperthermia in co-culture setting of {TAMC} or {BM}-{MCS} associated with ovarian cancer cell lines ({SKOV}3 and {CaOV}3) with polyvariate flow cytometry. We demonstrate that hyperthermia does not challenge survival of {TAMC} or bone marrow derived {MSC} ({BM}-{MSC}). Both {TAMC} and {BM}-{MSC} displayed strong protective effect inducing thermotolerance in ovarian cancer cells ({OCC}). Transwell experiments demonstrated the role of secreted factors. We showed that {CXCL}12 was inducing thermotolerance and that inhibition of {CXCL}12/{CXCR}4 interaction restored cytotoxicity of hyperthermia in co-culture experiments. Contrary to the previous published study we demonstrated that {TAMC} and {BM}-{MSC} co-cultured with {OCC} induced thermotolerance in a {CXCL}12 dependant manner. Targeting the interaction between stromal and cancer cells through {CXCL}12 inhibition might restore hyperthermia sensitivity in ovarian cancers, and thus improve {HIPEC} efficiency.},

The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

As the ability to measure molecules in high-throughput ways has improved over the past decade, it is logical that such data might be useful for enabling drug repositioning through computational methods. Many computational predictions for new indications have been borne out in cellular model systems, though extensive animal model and clinical trial-based validation are still pending. In this review, we show that computational methods for drug repositioning can be classified in two axes: drug based, where discovery initiates from the chemical perspective, or disease based, where discovery initiates from the clinical perspective of disease or its pathology. Newer algorithms for computational drug repositioning will likely span these two axes, will take advantage of newer types of molecular measurements, and will certainly play a role in reducing the global burden of disease.},

Early age at first birth, increasing parity, and tamoxifen use are related to long-term lifetime reduction in breast-cancer risk. Ductal carcinomas in situ has been suggested to be renamed ductal intraepithelial neoplasia to emphasise its non-life-threatening nature. An alternative approach, the progenitor/stem cell theory, predicts that only some tumour cells cause cancer progression and that these should be targeted by treatment. Mammography and ultrasonography are still the most effective for women with non-dense and dense breast tissues, respectively. Additionally, {MRI}, lymphatic mapping, the nipple-sparing mastectomy, partial breast irradiation, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and adjuvant treatments are promising for subgroups of breast-cancer patients. Although tamoxifen can be offered for endocrine-responsive disease, aromatase inhibitors are increasingly used. Assessment of potential molecular targets is now important in primary diagnosis. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and other drugs with anti-angiogenesis properties are currently undergoing preclinical investigations.},

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in {\textasciitilde}40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by {CNAs}, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in {PPP}2R2A, {MTAP} and {MAP}2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired {DNA}–{RNA} profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘{CNA}-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic {CNAs} on the transcriptome.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Genome-wide {DNA} hypomethylation plays a role in genomic instability and carcinogenesis. {LINE}-1 (L1 retrotransposon) constitutes a substantial portion of the human genome, and {LINE}-1 methylation correlates with global {DNA} methylation status. {LINE}-1 hypomethylation in colon cancer has been strongly associated with poor prognosis. However, whether {LINE}-1 hypomethylators constitute a distinct cancer subtype remains uncertain. Recent evidence for concordant {LINE}-1 hypomethylation within synchronous colorectal cancer pairs suggests the presence of a non-stochastic mechanism influencing tumor {LINE}-1 methylation level. Thus, it is of particular interest to examine whether its wide variation can be attributed to clinical, pathologic or molecular features. {DESIGN}: Utilizing a database of 869 colorectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies, we constructed multivariate linear and logistic regression models for {LINE}-1 methylation (quantified by Pyrosequencing). Variables included age, sex, body mass index, family history of colorectal cancer, smoking status, tumor location, stage, grade, mucinous component, signet ring cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, {CpG} island methylator phenotype ({CIMP}), microsatellite instability, expression of {TP}53 (p53), {CDKN}1A (p21), {CTNNB}1 (beta-catenin), {PTGS}2 (cyclooxygenase-2), and {FASN}, and mutations in {KRAS}, {BRAF}, and {PIK}3CA. {RESULTS}: Tumoral {LINE}-1 methylation ranged from 23.1 to 90.3 of 0-100 scale (mean 61.4; median 62.3; standard deviation 9.6), and distributed approximately normally except for extreme hypomethylators [{LINE}-1 methylation {\textless} 40; N = 22 (2.5\%), which were far more than what could be expected by normal distribution]. {LINE}-1 extreme hypomethylators were significantly associated with younger patients (p = 0.0058). Residual plot by multivariate linear regression showed that {LINE}-1 extreme hypomethylators clustered as one distinct group, separate from the main tumor group. The multivariate linear regression model could explain 8.4\% of the total variability of {LINE}-1 methylation (R-square = 0.084). Multivariate logistic regression models for binary {LINE}-1 hypomethylation outcomes (cutoffs of 40, 50 and 60) showed at most fair predictive ability (area under receiver operator characteristics curve {\textless} 0.63). {CONCLUSIONS}: {LINE}-1 extreme hypomethylators appear to constitute a previously-unrecognized, distinct subtype of colorectal cancers, which needs to be confirmed by additional studies. Our tumor {LINE}-1 methylation data indicate enormous epigenomic diversity of individual colorectal cancers.},

The effects of {BRCA}1 on {IGF}1R were assessed in 121 serous ovarian cancer patients ({BRCA}1 mutation, n=30; non-{BRCA}1 mutation, n=32; hypermethylated {BRCA}1 promoter, n=28; and non-methylation, n=31). {BRCA}1 promoter methylation was analyzed via bisulfite sequencing using primers focused on the core promoter region. The expression levels of {BRCA}1 and {IGF}1R were assessed by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Knockdown and overexpression of {BRCA}1 were achieved using a lentiviral vector in 293T and {SKOV}3 ovarian cancer cells, and primary non-mutated and {BRCA}1-mutated ovarian cancer cells. The present study demonstrated that {IGF}1R expression is increased in non-{BRCA}1-mutated ovarian cancer when compared with adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, {IGF}1R levels are additionally significantly elevated in {BRCA}1 inactivation ovarian cancer ({BRCA}1 mutation or hypermethylated {BRCA}1 promoter). In addition, {BRCA}1 knockdown was found to be an effective method of activating {IGF}1R expression in non-{BRCA}1-mutated ovarian cancer cells. The observations of the current study indicate that {BRCA}1 may be a potential trigger that is involved in the transcriptional regulation of {IGF}1R in the development of ovarian cancer.},

A technique for rigorously characterizing changes in mixed populations of cells, microarray expression deconvolution, has been applied to several areas of biology but not to {SLE} or to blood. Here we demonstrate that microarray expression deconvolution accurately quantifies the constituents of real blood samples and mixtures of immune-derived cell lines. We characterize a broad spectrum of peripheral leukocyte cell types and states in {SLE} to uncover novel patterns including: specific activation of {NK} and T helper lymphocytes, relationships of these patterns to each other, and correlations to clinical variables and measures. The expansion and activation of monocytes, {NK} cells, and T helper cells in {SLE} at least partly underlie this disease's prominent interferon signature. These and other patterns of leukocyte dynamics uncovered here correlate with disease severity and treatment, suggest potential new treatments, and extend our understanding of lupus pathology as a complex autoimmune disease involving many arms of the immune system.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The healthy vascular endothelium, which forms the barrier between blood and the surrounding tissues, is known to efficiently respond to stress signals like hypoxia and inflammation by adaptation of cellular physiology and the secretion of (soluble) growth factors and cytokines. Exosomes are potent mediators of intercellular communication. Their content consists of {RNA} and proteins from the cell of origin, and thus depends on the condition of these cells at the time of exosome biogenesis. It has been suggested that exosomes protect their target cells from cellular stress through the transfer of {RNA} and proteins. We hypothesized that endothelium-derived exosomes are involved in the endothelial response to cellular stress, and that exosome {RNA} and protein content reflect the effects of cellular stress induced by hypoxia, inflammation or hyperglycemia.
{METHODS}: We exposed cultured endothelial cells to different types of cellular stress (hypoxia, {TNF}-α-induced activation, high glucose and mannose concentrations) and compared {mRNA} and protein content of exosomes produced by these cells by microarray analysis and a quantitative proteomics approach.
{RESULTS}: We identified 1,354 proteins and 1,992 {mRNAs} in endothelial cell-derived exosomes. Several proteins and {mRNAs} showed altered abundances after exposure of their producing cells to cellular stress, which were confirmed by immunoblot or {qPCR} analysis.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data show that hypoxia and endothelial activation are reflected in {RNA} and protein exosome composition, and that exposure to high sugar concentrations alters exosome protein composition only to a minor extend, and does not affect exosome {RNA} composition.},

Here we describe a statistical method, Gene Relationships Among Implicated Loci ({GRAIL}), that takes a list of disease regions and automatically assesses the degree of relatedness of implicated genes using 250,000 {PubMed} abstracts. We first evaluated {GRAIL} by assessing its ability to identify subsets of highly related genes in common pathways from validated lipid and height {SNP} associations from recent genome-wide studies. We then tested {GRAIL}, by assessing its ability to separate true disease regions from many false positive disease regions in two separate practical applications in human genetics. First, we took 74 nominally associated Crohn's disease {SNPs} and applied {GRAIL} to identify a subset of 13 {SNPs} with highly related genes. Of these, ten convincingly validated in follow-up genotyping; genotyping results for the remaining three were inconclusive. Next, we applied {GRAIL} to 165 rare deletion events seen in schizophrenia cases (less than one-third of which are contributing to disease risk). We demonstrate that {GRAIL} is able to identify a subset of 16 deletions containing highly related genes; many of these genes are expressed in the central nervous system and play a role in neuronal synapses. {GRAIL} offers a statistically robust approach to identifying functionally related genes from across multiple disease regions--that likely represent key disease pathways.

The conceptual framework established by these studies converged on three important aspects. First, subtypes in each tumor group originate from distinct cell types. Second, each cell-of-origin is uniquely susceptible to some but not other genetic mutations.

We interrogated {RNA}-Seq data from 3,775 malignant neoplasms in The Cancer Genome Atlas database for the presence of viral sequences. Viral integration sites were also detected in expressed transcripts using a novel approach. The detection capacity of {RNA}-Seq was compared to available clinical laboratory data. Human papillomavirus ({HPV}) transcripts were detected using {RNA}-Seq analysis in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Detection of {HPV} by {RNA}-Seq correlated with detection by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in squamous cell carcinoma tumors of the head and neck. Hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus ({EBV}) were detected using {RNA}-Seq in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma tumors, respectively. Integration sites of viral genes and oncogenes were detected in cancers harboring {HPV} or hepatitis B virus but not in {EBV}-positive gastric carcinoma. Integration sites of expressed viral transcripts frequently involved known coding areas of the host genome. No {DNA} virus transcripts were detected in acute myeloid leukemia, cutaneous melanoma, low- and high-grade gliomas of the brain, and adenocarcinomas of the breast, colon and rectum, lung, prostate, ovary, kidney, and thyroid.

While further validation is necessary for specific cancer types, our findings highlight the utility of {RNA}-Seq in detecting tumor-associated {DNA} viruses and identifying viral integration sites that may unravel novel mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis.},

However, how enhancer sequences and {TF} motifs relate to enhancer activity is unknown, and general sequence requirements for enhancers or comprehensive sets of important enhancer sequence elements have remained elusive. Here, we computationally dissect thousands of functional enhancer sequences from three different Drosophila cell lines. We find that the enhancers display distinct cis-regulatory sequence signatures, which are predictive of the enhancers’ cell type-specific or broad activities. These signatures contain transcription factor motifs and a novel class of enhancer sequence elements, dinucleotide repeat motifs ({DRMs}). {DRMs} are highly enriched in enhancers, particularly in enhancers that are broadly active across different cell types. We experimentally validate the importance of the identified {TF} motifs and {DRMs} for enhancer function and show that they can be sufficient to create an active enhancer de novo from a nonfunctional sequence. The function of {DRMs} as a novel class of general enhancer features that are also enriched in human regulatory regions might explain their implication in several diseases and provides important insights into gene regulation.},

These two major tumor subtypes express markers corresponding to the major differentiation states of epithelial cells in the breast: luminal ({EpCAM}+) and basal/myoepithelial ({CD}10+). However, there are also rare types of breast cancers, such as metaplastic carcinomas, where tumor cells exhibit features of alternate cell types that no longer resemble breast epithelium. Until now, it has been difficult to identify the cell type(s) in the human breast that gives rise to these various forms of breast cancer. Here we report that transformation of {EpCAM}+ epithelial cells results in the formation of common forms of human breast cancer, including estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative tumors with luminal and basal-like characteristics, respectively, whereas transformation of {CD}10+ cells results in the development of rare metaplastic tumors reminiscent of the claudin-low subtype. We also demonstrate the existence of {CD}10+ breast cells with metaplastic traits that can give rise to skin and epidermal tissues. Furthermore, we show that the development of metaplastic breast cancer is attributable, in part, to the transformation of these metaplastic breast epithelial cells. These findings identify normal cellular precursors to human breast cancers and reveal the existence of a population of cells with epidermal progenitor activity within adult human breast tissues.},

In parallel, we determined the response to steady state overexpression of {MYCN} and {MYCNDeltaMBII} in the same cell type. An overlapping set of 398 genes from the two protocols was designated a 'Core {MYC} Signature' and used for further analysis. Comparison of the Core {MYC} Signature to a published study of the genes induced by serum stimulation revealed that only 7.4\% of the Core {MYC} Signature genes are in the Core Serum Response and display similar expression changes to both {MYC} and serum. Furthermore, more than 50\% of the Core {MYC} Signature genes were not influenced by serum stimulation. In contrast, comparison to a panel of breast cancers revealed a strong concordance in gene expression between the Core {MYC} Signature and the basal-like breast tumor subtype, which is a subtype with poor prognosis. This concordance was supported by the higher average level of {MYC} expression in the same tumor samples. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE} The Core {MYC} Signature has clinical relevance as this profile can be used to deduce an underlying genetic program that is likely to contribute to a clinical phenotype. Therefore, the presence of the Core {MYC} Signature may predict clinical responsiveness to therapeutics that are designed to disrupt {MYC}-mediated phenotypes.},

Because physical activity is one of the few modifiable risk factors, it may provide a target to add to breast cancer prevention in this high-risk population. We examined the association between self-reported lifetime sports activity and breast cancer risk in a nationwide retrospective cohort study, including 725 carriers, of whom 218 had been diagnosed with breast cancer within 10 years prior to questionnaire completion. We found a nonsignificantly decreased risk for ever engaging in sports activity ({HR} = 0.84, 95\%{CI} = 0.57-1.24). Among women who had participated in sports, a medium versus low level of intensity and duration (i.e., between 11.0 and 22.7 mean {MET} hours/week averaged over a lifetime) reduced the risk of breast cancer ({HR} = 0.59, 95\%{CI} = 0.36-0.95); no dose-response trend was observed. For mean hours/week of sports activity, a nonsignificant trend was observed ({HR}(low versus never) = 0.93, 95\%{CI} = 0.60-1.43; {HR}(medium versus never) = 0.81, 95\%{CI} = 0.51-1.29; {HR}(high versus never) = 0.78, 95\%{CI} = 0.48-1.29; p (trend overall) = 0.272; p (trend active women) = 0.487).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The p53 gene family consists of the three genes p53, p63 and p73, which have polyhedral non-overlapping functions in pivotal cellular processes such as {DNA} synthesis and repair, growth arrest, apoptosis, genome stability, angiogenesis, development and differentiation. These genes encode sequence-specific nuclear transcription factors that recognise the same responsive element ({RE}) in their target genes. Their inactivation or aberrant expression may determine tumour progression or developmental disease. The discovery of several protein isoforms with antagonistic roles, which are produced by the expression of different promoters and alternative splicing, widened the complexity of the scenario of the transcriptional network of the p53 family members. Therefore, the identification of the genes transactivated by p53 family members is crucial to understand the specific role for each gene in cell cycle regulation. We have combined a genome-wide computational search of p53 family {REs} and microarray analysis to identify new direct target genes. The huge amount of biological data produced has generated a critical need for bioinformatic tools able to manage and integrate such data and facilitate their retrieval and analysis. {DESCRIPTION}: We have developed the p53FamTaG database (p53 {FAMily} {TArget} Genes), a modular relational database, which contains p53 family direct target genes selected in the human genome searching for the presence of the {REs} and the expression profile of these target genes obtained by microarray experiments. p53FamTaG database also contains annotations of publicly available databases and links to other experimental data. The genome-wide computational search of the {REs} was performed using {PatSearch}, a pattern-matching program implemented in the {DNAfan} tool. These data were integrated with the microarray results we produced from the overexpression of different isoforms of p53, p63 and p73 stably transfected in isogenic cell lines, allowing the comparative study of the transcriptional activity of all the proteins in the same cellular background.p53FamTaG database is available free at http://www2.ba.itb.cnr.it/p53FamTaG/ {CONCLUSION}: p53FamTaG represents a unique integrated resource of human direct p53 family target genes that is extensively annotated and provides the users with an efficient query/retrieval system which displays the results of our microarray experiments and allows the export of {RE} sequences. The database was developed for supporting and integrating high-throughput in silico and experimental analyses and represents an important reference source of knowledge for research groups involved in the field of oncogenesis, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.},

These conversions are irreversible; the original gene names cannot be recovered.

	abstract = {Breast milk is a complex liquid with immune-competent cells and soluble proteins that provide immunity to the infant and affect the maturation of the infant's immune system. Exosomes are nanovesicles (30-100 nm) with an endosome-derived limiting membrane secreted by a diverse range of cell types. Because exosomes carry immunorelevant structures, they are suggested to participate in directing the immune response. We hypothesized that human breast milk contain exosomes, which may be important for the development of the infant's immune system. We isolated vesicles from the human colostrum and mature breast milk by ultracentrifugations and/or immuno-isolation on paramagnetic beads. We found that the vesicles displayed a typical exosome-like size and morphology as analyzed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, they floated at a density between 1.10 and 1.18 g/ml in a sucrose gradient, corresponding to the known density of exosomes. In addition, {MHC} classes I and {II}, {CD}63, {CD}81, and {CD}86 were detected on the vesicles by flow cytometry. Western blot and mass spectrometry further confirmed the presence of several exosome-associated molecules. Functional analysis revealed that the vesicle preparation inhibited anti-{CD}3-induced {IL}-2 and {IFN}-gamma production from allogeneic and autologous {PBMC}. In addition, an increased number of Foxp3(+){CD}4(+){CD}25(+) T regulatory cells were observed in {PBMC} incubated with milk vesicle preparations.

Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents.

Therefore, identification of cell lines with normal-like expression profiles is of paramount importance in studies of normal gene regulation.The {mRNA} and {miRNA} expression profiles of several breast cell lines of cancerous or normal origin were measured using printed slide arrays, Luminex bead arrays, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.We demonstrate that the {mRNA} expression profiles of two breast cell lines are similar to that of normal breast tissue: {HB}4a, immortalised normal breast epithelium, and {PMC}42, a breast cancer cell line that retains progenitor pluripotency allowing in-culture differentiation to both secretory and myoepithelial fates. In contrast, only {PMC}42 exhibits a normal-like {miRNA} expression profile. We identified a group of {miRNAs} that are highly expressed in normal breast tissue and {PMC}42 but are lost in all other cancerous and normal-origin breast cell lines and observed a similar loss in immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines compared with healthy uncultured B cells. Moreover, like tumour suppressor genes, these {miRNAs} are lost in a variety of tumours. We show that the mechanism leading to the loss of these {miRNAs} in breast cancer cell lines has genomic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional components.We propose that, despite its neoplastic origin, {PMC}42 is an excellent molecular model for normal breast epithelium, providing a unique tool to study breast differentiation and the function of key {miRNAs} that are typically lost in cancer.},

In all cases, regulator deletions increased, rather than decreased, the expression differences between the species, revealing hidden genetic variability that was masked in the wild-type backgrounds. This effect was not observed for individual deletions of 11 enzymes involved in central metabolic pathways. The buffered variations were associated with trans differences, as revealed by allele-specific profiling of the interspecific hybrids. Our results support the idea that regulatory proteins serve as capacitors that buffer gene expression against hidden genetic variability.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

It is common for the results of a microarray study to be analyzed in the context of biologically-motivated groups of genes such as pathways or Gene Ontology categories. The most common method for such analysis uses the hypergeometric distribution (or a related technique) to look for "over-representation" of groups among genes selected as being differentially expressed or otherwise of interest based on a gene-by-gene analysis. However, this method suffers from some limitations, and biologist-friendly tools that implement alternatives have not been reported.


{RESULTS}

We introduce {ErmineJ}, a multiplatform user-friendly stand-alone software tool for the analysis of functionally-relevant sets of genes in the context of microarray gene expression data. {ErmineJ} implements multiple algorithms for gene set analysis, including over-representation and resampling-based methods that focus on gene scores or correlation of gene expression profiles. In addition to a graphical user interface, {ErmineJ} has a command line interface and an application programming interface that can be used to automate analyses. The graphical user interface includes tools for creating and modifying gene sets, visualizing the Gene Ontology as a table or tree, and visualizing gene expression data. {ErmineJ} comes with a complete user manual, and is open-source software licensed under the Gnu Public License.


{CONCLUSION}

The availability of multiple analysis algorithms, together with a rich feature set and simple graphical interface, should make {ErmineJ} a useful addition to the biologist's informatics toolbox. {ErmineJ} is available from http://microarray.cu.genome.org.},

To discover the {microRNAs} regulating this critical transition, we used 80 biopsies from invasive ductal carcinoma, 8 from ductal carcinoma in situ, and 6 from normal breast. We selected them from a recently published deep-sequencing dataset [Farazi {TA}, et al. (2011) Cancer Res 71:4443–4453]. The {microRNA} profile established for the normal breast to ductal carcinoma in situ transition was largely maintained in the in situ to invasive ductal carcinoma transition. Nevertheless, a nine-{microRNA} signature was identified that differentiated invasive from in situ carcinoma. Specifically, let-7d, {miR}-210, and -221 were down-regulated in the in situ and up-regulated in the invasive transition, thus featuring an expression reversal along the cancer progression path. Additionally, we identified {microRNAs} for overall survival and time to metastasis. Five noncoding genes were associated with both prognostic signatures—{miR}-210, -21, -106b*, -197, and let-7i, with {miR}-210 the only one also involved in the invasive transition. To pinpoint critical cellular functions affected in the invasive transition, we identified the protein coding genes with inversely related profiles to {miR}-210: {BRCA}1, {FANCD}, {FANCF}, {PARP}1, E-cadherin, and Rb1 were all activated in the in situ and down-regulated in the invasive carcinoma. Additionally, we detected differential splicing isoforms with special features, including a truncated {EGFR} lacking the kinase domain and overexpressed only in ductal carcinoma in situ.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

A more accurate means of prognostication in breast cancer will improve the selection of patients for adjuvant systemic therapy.


{METHODS}

Using microarray analysis to evaluate our previously established 70-gene prognosis profile, we classified a series of 295 consecutive patients with primary breast carcinomas as having a gene-expression signature associated with either a poor prognosis or a good prognosis. All patients had stage I or {II} breast cancer and were younger than 53 years old; 151 had lymph-node-negative disease, and 144 had lymph-node-positive disease. We evaluated the predictive power of the prognosis profile using univariable and multivariable statistical analyses.


{RESULTS}

Among the 295 patients, 180 had a poor-prognosis signature and 115 had a good-prognosis signature, and the mean (+/-{SE}) overall 10-year survival rates were 54.6+/-4.4 percent and 94.5+/-2.6 percent, respectively. At 10 years, the probability of remaining free of distant metastases was 50.6+/-4.5 percent in the group with a poor-prognosis signature and 85.2+/-4.3 percent in the group with a good-prognosis signature. The estimated hazard ratio for distant metastases in the group with a poor-prognosis signature, as compared with the group with the good-prognosis signature, was 5.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 9.0; P{\textless}0.001). This ratio remained significant when the groups were analyzed according to lymph-node status. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that the prognosis profile was a strong independent factor in predicting disease outcome.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The gene-expression profile we studied is a more powerful predictor of the outcome of disease in young patients with breast cancer than standard systems based on clinical and histologic criteria.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIM}: The phenomenon of membrane vesicle-release by neoplastic cells is a growing field of interest in cancer research, due to their potential role in carrying a large array of tumor antigens when secreted into the extracellular medium. In particular, experimental evidence show that at least some of the tumor markers detected in the blood circulation of mammary carcinoma patients are carried by membrane-bound vesicles. Thus, biomarker research in breast cancer can gain great benefits from vesicle characterization.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Conditioned medium was collected from serum starved {MDA}-{MB}-231 sub-confluent cell cultures and exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Ultrastructural analysis of {ELVs} was performed by transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) and the purity of fraction was confirmed by western blotting assays. Proteomic profile of {ELVs} was carried out by 2 D-{PAGE} and protein identification performed by {MALDI}-{ToF} Mass Spectrometry.
{RESULTS}: On the basis of ultrastructural and immunological characterization, the isolated vesicles have been classified as exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}). The proteomic investigation showed a distinctive protein profile of the {ELVs}, in comparison to the whole cell lisates ({WCL}) proteome, which could be instrumental for cancer progression. The proteins were clustered into functional categories, according to the current bioinformatics resources and a Venn diagram was constructed based on these clusters.
{CONCLUSION}: It is reasonable to assume that vesicle production allows neoplastic cells to exert different effects, according to the possible acceptor targets. For instance, vesicles could potentiate the malignant properties of adjacent neoplastic cells or activate non-tumoral cells. Moreover, vesicles could convey signals to immune cells and surrounding stroma cells. The present study may significantly contribute to the knowledge of the vesiculation phenomenon, which is a critical device for trans cellular communication in cancer.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: High-grade serous cancer ({HGSC}) is the most common cancer of the ovary and is characterized by chromosomal instability. Defects in homologous recombination repair ({HRR}) are associated with genomic instability in {HGSC}, and are exploited by therapy targeting {DNA} repair. Defective {HRR} causes uniparental deletions and loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}). Our purpose is to profile {LOH} in {HGSC} and correlate our findings to clinical outcome, and compare {HGSC} and high-grade breast cancers.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We examined {LOH} and copy number changes using single nucleotide polymorphism array data from three {HGSC} cohorts and compared results to a cohort of high-grade breast cancers. The {LOH} profiles in {HGSC} were matched to chemotherapy resistance and progression-free survival ({PFS}).
{RESULTS}: {LOH}-based clustering divided {HGSC} into two clusters. The major group displayed extensive {LOH} and was further divided into two subgroups. The second group contained remarkably less {LOH}. {BRCA}1 promoter methylation was associated with the major group. {LOH} clusters were reproducible when validated in two independent {HGSC} datasets. {LOH} burden in the major cluster of {HGSC} was similar to triple-negative, and distinct from other high-grade breast cancers. Our analysis revealed an {LOH} cluster with lower treatment resistance and a significant correlation between {LOH} burden and {PFS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Separating {HGSC} by {LOH}-based clustering produces remarkably stable subgroups in three different cohorts. Patients in the various {LOH} clusters differed with respect to chemotherapy resistance, and the extent of {LOH} correlated with {PFS}. {LOH} burden may indicate vulnerability to treatment targeting {DNA} repair, such as {PARP}1 inhibitors.},

Several in silico methods for deconvoluting a gene expression profile into cell-type-specific subprofiles have been published but not widely used. Here, we consider recent methods and the experimental validations available for them. Shen-Orr et al. recently developed an approach called cell-type-specific significance analysis of microarray for deconvoluting gene expression. This method requires the measurement of the proportion of each cell type in each sample and the expression profiles of the heterogeneous samples. It determines how gene expression varies among pre-defined phenotypes for each cell type. Gene expression can vary substantially among cell types and sample heterogeneity can mask the identification of biologically important phenotypic correlations. Consequently, the deconvolution approach can be useful in the analysis of mixtures of cell populations in clinical samples.

	abstract = {{RNA} sequencing ({RNA}–seq) provides novel opportunities for transcriptomic studies at nucleotide resolution, including transcriptomics of viruses or microbes infecting a cell. However, standard approaches for mapping the resulting sequencing reads generally ignore alternative sources of expression other than the host cell and are little equipped to address the problems arising from redundancies and gaps among sequenced microbe and virus genomes. We show that screening of sequencing reads for contaminations and infections can be performed easily using {ContextMap}, our recently developed mapping software. Based on mapping–derived statistics, mapping confidence, similarities and misidentifications (e.g. due to missing genome sequences) of species/strains can be assessed. Performance of our approach is evaluated on three real–life sequencing data sets and compared to state–of–the–art metagenomics tools. In particular, {ContextMap} vastly outperformed {GASiC} and {GRAMMy} in terms of runtime. In contrast to {MEGAN}4, it was capable of providing individual read mappings to species and resolving non–unique mappings, thus allowing the identification of misalignments caused by sequence similarities between genomes and missing genome sequences. Our study illustrates the importance and potentials of routinely mining {RNA}–seq experiments for infections or contaminations by microbes and viruses. By using {ContextMap}, gene expression of infecting agents can be analyzed and novel insights in infection processes and tumorigenesis can be obtained.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: High serum levels of estradiol are associated with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Little is known about the gene expression in normal breast tissue in relation to levels of circulating serum estradiol.
{METHODS}: We compared whole genome expression data of breast tissue samples with serum hormone levels using data from 79 healthy women and 64 breast cancer patients. Significance analysis of microarrays ({SAM}) was used to identify differentially expressed genes and multivariate linear regression was used to identify independent associations.
{RESULTS}: Six genes ({SCGB}3A1, {RSPO}1, {TLN}2, {SLITRK}4, {DCLK}1, {PTGS}1) were found differentially expressed according to serum estradiol levels ({FDR} = 0). Three of these independently predicted estradiol levels in a multivariate model, as {SCGB}3A1 ({HIN}1) and {TLN}2 were up-regulated and {PTGS}1 ({COX}1) was down-regulated in breast samples from women with high serum estradiol. Serum estradiol, but none of the differentially expressed genes were significantly associated with mammographic density, another strong breast cancer risk factor. In breast carcinomas, expression of {GREB}1 and {AREG} was associated with serum estradiol in all cancers and in the subgroup of estrogen receptor positive cases.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We have identified genes associated with serum estradiol levels in normal breast tissue and in breast carcinomas. {SCGB}3A1 is a suggested tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cell growth and invasion and is methylated and down-regulated in many epithelial cancers. Our findings indicate this gene as an important inhibitor of breast cell proliferation in healthy women with high estradiol levels. In the breast, this gene is expressed in luminal cells only and is methylated in non-{BRCA}-related breast cancers. The possibility of a carcinogenic contribution of silencing of this gene for luminal, but not basal-like cancers should be further explored. {PTGS}1 induces prostaglandin E2 ({PGE}2) production which in turn stimulates aromatase expression and hence increases the local production of estradiol. This is the first report studying such associations in normal breast tissue in humans.},

{OBJECTIVES}: To determine potential sources of {TF} and the mechanisms of its availability in the lung microenvironment.
{METHODS}: Normal human bronchial epithelial cells grown in air-liquid interface culture were subjected to a compressive stress of 30 cm H(2)O; this is comparable to that generated in the airway epithelium during bronchoconstriction in asthma. Conditioned media and cells were harvested to measure {TF} {mRNA} and {TF} protein. We also tested bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and airway biopsies from asthmatic patients and healthy controls for {TF}.
{RESULTS}: {TF} {mRNA} was upregulated 2.2-fold after 3 hours of stress compared with unstressed cells. Intracellular and secreted {TF} proteins were enhanced 1.6-fold and more than 50-fold, respectively, compared with those of control cells after the onset of compression. The amount of {TF} in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with asthma was found at mean concentrations that were 5 times greater than those of healthy controls. Immunohistochemical staining of endobronchial biopsies identified epithelial localization of {TF} with increased expression in asthma. Exosomes isolated from the conditioned media of normal human bronchial epithelial cells and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic subjects by ultracentrifugation contained {TF}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that mechanically stressed bronchial epithelial cells are a source of secreted {TF} and that exosomes are potentially a key carrier of the {TF} signal.},

	doi = {10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1369},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Previously, we found that gene expression in histologically normal breast epithelium ({NlEpi}) from women at high breast cancer risk can resemble gene expression in {NlEpi} from cancer-containing breasts. Therefore, we hypothesized that gene expression characteristic of a cancer subtype might be seen in {NlEpi} of breasts containing that subtype.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We examined gene expression in 46 cases of microdissected {NlEpi} from untreated women undergoing breast cancer surgery. From 30 age-matched cases [15 estrogen receptor ({ER})+, 15 {ER}-] we used Affymetryix U133A arrays. From 16 independent cases (9 {ER}+, 7 {ER}-), we validated selected genes using quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}). We then compared gene expression between {NlEpi} and invasive breast cancer using four publicly available data sets.
{RESULTS}: We identified 198 genes that are differentially expressed between {NlEpi} from breasts with {ER}+ ({NlEpiER}+) compared with {ER}- cancers ({NlEpiER}-). These include genes characteristic of {ER}+ and {ER}- cancers (e.g., {ESR}1, {GATA}3, and {CX}3CL1, {FABP}7). {qPCR} validated the microarray results in both the 30 original cases and the 16 independent cases. Gene expression in {NlEpiER}+ and {NlEpiER}- resembled gene expression in {ER}+ and {ER}- cancers, respectively: 25\% to 53\% of the genes or probes examined in four external data sets overlapped between {NlEpi} and the corresponding cancer subtype.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Gene expression differs in {NlEpi} of breasts containing {ER}+ compared with {ER}- breast cancers. These differences echo differences in {ER}+ and {ER}- invasive cancers. {NlEpi} gene expression may help elucidate subtype-specific risk signatures, identify early genomic events in cancer development, and locate targets for prevention and therapy.},

Circulating tumor-derived vesicles have major potential as biomarkers; however, the diagnostic use of exosomes is limited by the technology available for their objective characterization and measurement. In this study, we compare nanoparticle tracking analysis ({NTA}) with submicron particle analysis ({SPA}), dynamic light scattering ({DLS}), and electron microscopy ({EM}) to objectively define size distribution, number, and phenotype of circulating cell-derived vesicles from ovarian cancer patients. Using the {NanoSight} {LM}10 instrument, cell-derived vesicles were visualized by laser light scattering and analyzing Brownian motion of these vesicles captured by video. The {NTA} software calculates the size and total concentration of the vesicles in solution. Using vesicles isolated from ovarian cancer patients, we demonstrate that {NTA} can measure the size distributions of cell-derived vesicles comparable to other analysis instrumentation. Size determinations by {NTA}, {SPA}, and {DLS} were more objective and complete than that obtained with the commonly used {EM} approach. {NTA} can also define the total vesicle concentration. Furthermore, the use of fluorescent-labeled antibodies against specific markers with {NTA} allows the determination of the "phenotype" of the cell-derived vesicles.},

Whites had higher incidence rates than blacks after age 40 years, but the reverse was true among younger women (black-white crossover). Among younger women, the rate per 100,000 woman-years was 16.8 for black vs 15.1 for white women; the highest black-white incidence rate ratio ({IRR}) was seen among women younger than 30 years ({IRR} = 1.52, 95\% confidence interval = 1.34 to 1.73). This risk pattern was not observed in other ethnic groups. The black-white crossover among younger women was largely restricted to breast cancers with favorable tumor characteristics. The annual percentage change in the incidence of invasive breast cancers decreased modestly among older women but increased among younger ({\textless}40 years) white women. Continued surveillance of trends is needed, particularly for molecular subtypes that preferentially occur among young women.},

We present an integrated analysis of copy number and gene expression in a discovery and validation set of 997 and 995 primary breast tumours, respectively, with long-term clinical follow-up. Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in {\textasciitilde}40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by {CNAs}, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in {PPP}2R2A, {MTAP} and {MAP}2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired {DNA}–{RNA} profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘{CNA}-devoid’ subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network.

However, neither {IL}-1 alpha nor {IL}-1 beta are neurotoxic per se in vivo, so other {IL}-1 related ligands may be important in neurodegeneration. The cytokine interleukin-18 (also called interferon gamma inducing factor, {IGIF}) was first isolated from the liver of mice during toxic shock. It was later proposed as a member of the {IL}-1 family, based on protein sequence homology with {IL}-1 beta and {IL}-1ra, and has tentatively been called {IL}-1 gamma. We cloned {IL}-18 from adult rat brain and demonstrated, by {RT}-{PCR}, that it is expressed constitutively in cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cortex and striatum. Rat brain {IL}-18 shows close homology to mouse and human {IL}-18, and to the recently published sequence from the rat adrenal gland. Mouse pro-{IL}-18 and pro-{IL}-1 beta are processed by caspase-1.

Until fairly recently, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma seemed to be one of the only known deviants of these concepts.

However, it is known that, in complex diseases, phenotypes are determined not only by genes, but also by the underlying structure of genetic networks. Often, it is the interaction of many genes that causes phenotypic variations. {RESULTS} In this work, using cancer as an example, we develop graph-based methods to integrate multiple microarray datasets to discover disease-related co-expression network modules. We propose an unsupervised method that take into account both co-expression dynamics and network topological information to simultaneously infer network modules and phenotype conditions in which they are activated or de-activated. Using our method, we have discovered network modules specific to cancer or subtypes of cancers. Many of these modules are consistent with or supported by their functional annotations or their previously known involvement in cancer. In particular, we identified a module that is predominately activated in breast cancer and is involved in tumor suppression. While individual components of this module have been suggested to be associated with tumor suppression, their coordinated function has never been elucidated. Here by adopting a network perspective, we have identified their interrelationships and, particularly, a hub gene {PDGFRL} that may play an important role in this tumor suppressor network. {CONCLUSION} Using a network-based approach, our method provides new insights into the complex cellular mechanisms that characterize cancer and cancer subtypes. By incorporating co-expression dynamics information, our approach can not only extract more functionally homogeneous modules than those based solely on network topology, but also reveal pathway coordination beyond co-expression.},

Cocultures can be used to study cancer cell interactions with specific stromal components (e.g., immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelium) and different representative cell lines (e.g., cancer-associated versus normal-associated fibroblasts versus established, immortalized fibroblasts) can help elucidate the role of stromal variation in tumor phenotypes. Gene expression data can also be combined with cell-based assays to identify cellular phenotypes associated with gene expression changes.

	abstract = {Cell type heterogeneity may have a substantial effect on gene expression profiling of human tissue. Several in silico methods for deconvoluting a gene expression profile into cell-type-specific subprofiles have been published but not widely used. Here, we consider recent methods and the experimental validations available for them. Shen-Orr et al. recently developed an approach called cell-type-specific significance analysis of microarray for deconvoluting gene expression. This method requires the measurement of the proportion of each cell type in each sample and the expression profiles of the heterogeneous samples. It determines how gene expression varies among pre-defined phenotypes for each cell type. Gene expression can vary substantially among cell types and sample heterogeneity can mask the identification of biologically important phenotypic correlations. Consequently, the deconvolution approach can be useful in the analysis of mixtures of cell populations in clinical samples.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Preoperative chemotherapy in patients with primary breast cancer treated with anthracyclines and taxanes results in high response rates, allowing breast conserving surgery ({BCS}) in patients primarily not suitable for this procedure. Pathological responses are important prognostic parameters for progression free and overall survival. We questioned the impact of histologic type invasive ductal carcinoma ({IDC}) versus invasive lobular carcinoma ({ILC}) on response to primary chemotherapy. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: 161 patients with breast cancer received preoperative chemotherapy consisted of epidoxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) and docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) administered in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-{CSF}) on days 3-10 ({ED} + G). Pathological complete response ({pCR}), biological markers and type of surgery as well as progression free and overall survival were compared between {IDC} and {ILC}. {RESULTS}: Out of 161 patients, 124 patients presented with {IDC} and 37 with {ILC}. Patients with {ILC} were less likely to have a {pCR} (3\% vs. 20\%, P {\textless} 0.009) and breast conserving surgeries (51\% vs. 79\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Patients with {ILC} tended to have oestrogen receptor positive tumors (86\% vs. 52\%, P {\textless} 0.0001), {HER} 2 negative tumors (69\% vs. 84\%), and lower nuclear grade (nuclear grade 3, 16\% vs. 46\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Patients with {ILC} tended to have longer time to progression ({TTP}) (42 months vs. 26 months) and overall survival (69 months vs. 65 months). {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results indicate that patients with {ILC} achieved a lower {pCR} rate and ineligibility for {BCS} to preoperative chemotherapy, but this did not result in a survival disadvantage. Because of these results new strategies to achieve a {pCR} are warranted.},

We present a validation study to assess the prognostic significance in lymph node-negative, premenopausal patients from the perioperative chemotherapy trial ({POP} trial, 10854) conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. The {POP} trial assessed the efficacy of one course of perioperative chemotherapy (consisting of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained sections were retrieved from a subset of premenopausal, node-negative patients from this trial and were scored for the percentage of intra-tumoral stroma. The tumor-stroma ratio was associated with disease-free survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. Tumors with a high tumor-stroma ratio had an increased hazard of 1.853 for disease relapse (95 \%{CI} 1.327-2.585, P {\textless} 0.001) independent of other parameters. Combining other parameters with the tumor-stroma ratio improved risk stratification. For triple-negative tumors, the tumor-stroma ratio was associated with an increased hazard for disease relapse, independent of other parameters ({HR} 2.711, 95 \%{CI} 1.111-6.614, P = 0.028). The tumor-stroma ratio was also independently associated with locoregional recurrence even in breast cancer patients ≤40 years of age ({HR} 2.201, 95 \%{CI} 1.038-4.669, P = 0.040). This study validates the prognostic value of the tumor-stroma ratio.

	abstract = {Hyperactive inflammatory responses following cancer initiation have led to cancer being described as a 'wound that never heals'. These inflammatory responses elicit signals via {NFκB} leading to {IL}-6 production, and {IL}-6 in turn has been shown to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells in vitro, implicating a role for this cytokine in cancer cell invasion. We previously have shown that conditioned medium derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts induced an Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition ({EMT}) in {PMC}42-{LA} breast cancer cells and we have now identify {IL}-6 as present in this medium. We further show that {IL}-6 is expressed approximately 100 fold higher in a cancer-associated fibroblast line compared to normal fibroblasts. Comparison of mouse-specific (stroma) and human-specific (tumor) {IL}-6 {mRNA} expression from {MCF}-7, {MDA} {MB} 468 and {MDA} {MB} 231 xenografts also indicated the stroma rather than tumor as a significantly higher source of {IL}-6 expression. Mast cells ({MCs}) feature in inflammatory cancer-associated stroma, and activated {MCs} secrete {IL}-6. We observed a higher {MC} index (average number of mast cells per xenograft section/average tumor size) in {MDA} {MB} 468 compared to {MDA} {MB} 231 xenografts, where all {MC} were observed to be active (degranulating). This higher {MC} index correlated with greater mouse-specific {IL}-6 expression in the {MDA} {MB} 468 xenografts, implicating {MC} as an important source of stromal {IL}-6. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry on these xenografts for {pSTAT}3, which lies downstream of the {IL}-6 receptor indicated frequent correlations between {pSTAT}3 and mast cell positive cells. Analysis of publically available databases for {IL}-6 expression in patient tissue revealed higher {IL}-6 in laser capture microdissected stroma compared to adjacent tissue epithelium from patients with inflammatory breast cancer ({IBC}) and invasive non-inflammatory breast cancer (non-{IBC}) and we show that {IL}-6 expression was significantly higher in Basal versus Luminal molecular/phenotypic groupings of breast cancer cell lines. Finally, we discuss how afferent and efferent {IL}-6 pathways may participate in a positive feedback cycle to dictate tumor progression.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: We aimed to identify mechanisms driving local recurrence in a model of breast-conserving surgery ({BCS}) for breast cancer. {BACKGROUND}: Breast cancer recurrence after {BCS} remains a clinically significant, but poorly understood problem. We have previously reported that recurrent colorectal tumours demonstrate altered growth dynamics, increased metastatic burden and resistance to apoptosis, mediated by upregulation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt ({PI}3K/Akt). We investigated whether similar characteristics were evident in a model of locally recurrent breast cancer. {METHODS}: Tumours were generated by orthotopic inoculation of 4T1 cells in two groups of female Balb/c mice and cytoreductive surgery performed when mean tumour size was above 150 mm(3). Local recurrence was observed and gene expression was examined using Affymetrix {GeneChips} in primary and recurrent tumours. Differential expression was confirmed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ({qRT}-{PCR}). Phosphorylation of Akt was assessed using Western immunoblotting. An ex vivo heat shock protein ({HSP})-loaded dendritic cell vaccine was administered in the perioperative period. {RESULTS}: We observed a significant difference in the recurrent 4T1 tumour volume and growth rate (p {\textless} 0.05). Gene expression studies suggested roles for the {PI}3K/Akt system and local immunosuppression driving the altered growth kinetics. We demonstrated that perioperative vaccination with an ex vivo {HSP}-loaded dendritic cell vaccine abrogated recurrent tumour growth in vivo (p = 0.003 at day 15). {CONCLUSION}: Investigating therapies which target tumour survival pathways such as {PI}3K/Akt and boost immune surveillance in the perioperative period may be useful adjuncts to contemporary breast cancer treatment.},

Although no knowledge of patient survival or outcomes was used to derive these gene descriptions, these different classes based upon patterns of gene expression have important prognostic implications. Predictive markers in estrogen receptor-negative and triple-negative disease will be particularly important because in the absence of therapy, these tumor subtypes tend to have a poor prognosis. In addition, the claudin-low subgroup has been found to be common within the triple-negative cancers and may have further prognostic and therapeutic implications. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer do benefit from chemotherapy, but better treatment options are needed that are less toxic, reduce the risk of disease progression, and are more targeted to this patient population. Potential treatments include poly ({ADP}-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, and therapies that target cancer stem cells could also have an important impact in these patients. This article will focus on the molecular stratification of triple-negative breast cancers and the therapeutic implications of these classifications.},

To address this limitation, we developed the tumor cell-specific in vitro bioluminescence imaging ({CS}-{BLI}) assay. Tumor cells (for example, myeloma, leukemia and solid tumors) stably expressing luciferase are cultured with nonmalignant accessory cells (for example, stromal cells) for selective quantification of tumor cell viability, in presence versus absence of stromal cells or drug treatment. {CS}-{BLI} is high-throughput scalable and identifies stroma-induced chemoresistance in diverse malignancies, including imatinib resistance in leukemic cells. A stroma-induced signature in tumor cells correlates with adverse clinical prognosis and includes signatures for activated Akt, Ras, {NF}-{kappaB}, {HIF}-1alpha, myc, {hTERT} and {IRF}4; for biological aggressiveness; and for self-renewal. Unlike conventional screening, {CS}-{BLI} can also identify agents with increased activity against tumor cells interacting with stroma. One such compound, reversine, shows more potent activity in an orthotopic model of diffuse myeloma bone lesions than in conventional subcutaneous xenografts. Use of {CS}-{BLI}, therefore, enables refined screening of candidate anticancer agents to enrich preclinical pipelines with potential therapeutics that overcome stroma-mediated drug resistance and can act in a synthetic lethal manner in the context of tumor-stroma interactions.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing. {RESULTS}: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.},

Here, we discuss a unifying conceptual framework called "cancer immunoediting," which integrates the immune system's dual host-protective and tumor-promoting roles.},

Expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9 ({TNFRSF}9) from the {DLBCL} microenvironment was the best gene in bivariate combination with {LMO}2. Study of {TNFRSF}9 tissue expression in 95 patients with {DLBCL} showed expression limited to infiltrating T cells. A model integrating these 2 genes was independent of "cell-of-origin" classification, "stromal signatures," {IPI}, and added to the predictive power of the {IPI}. A composite score integrating these genes with {IPI} performed well in 3 independent cohorts of 545 {DLBCL} patients, as well as in a simple assay of routine formalin-fixed specimens from a new validation cohort of 147 patients with {DLBCL}. We conclude that the measurement of a single gene expressed by tumor cells ({LMO}2) and a single gene expressed by the immune microenvironment ({TNFRSF}9) powerfully predicts overall survival in patients with {DLBCL}.},

	abstract = {Extracellular vesicle ({EV})-mediated intercellular transfer of signaling proteins and nucleic acids has recently been implicated in the development of cancer and other pathological conditions; however, the mechanism of {EV} uptake and how this may be targeted remain as important questions. Here, we provide evidence that heparan sulfate ({HS}) proteoglycans ({PGs}; {HSPGs}) function as internalizing receptors of cancer cell-derived {EVs} with exosome-like characteristics. Internalized exosomes colocalized with cell-surface {HSPGs} of the syndecan and glypican type, and exosome uptake was specifically inhibited by free {HS} chains, whereas closely related chondroitin sulfate had no effect. By using several cell mutants, we provide genetic evidence of a receptor function of {HSPG} in exosome uptake, which was dependent on intact {HS}, specifically on the 2-O and N-sulfation groups. Further, enzymatic depletion of cell-surface {HSPG} or pharmacological inhibition of endogenous {PG} biosynthesis by xyloside significantly attenuated exosome uptake. We provide biochemical evidence that {HSPGs} are sorted to and associate with exosomes; however, exosome-associated {HSPGs} appear to have no direct role in exosome internalization. On a functional level, exosome-induced {ERK}1/2 signaling activation was attenuated in {PG}-deficient mutant cells as well as in {WT} cells treated with xyloside. Importantly, exosome-mediated stimulation of cancer cell migration was significantly reduced in {PG}-deficient mutant cells, or by treatment of {WT} cells with heparin or xyloside. We conclude that cancer cell-derived exosomes use {HSPGs} for their internalization and functional activity, which significantly extends the emerging role of {HSPGs} as key receptors of macromolecular cargo.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Public data integration may help overcome challenges in clinical implementation of microarray profiles. We integrated several ovarian cancer datasets to identify a reproducible predictor of survival.


{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}

Four microarray datasets from different institutions comprising 265 advanced stage tumors were uniformly reprocessed into a single training dataset, also adjusting for inter-laboratory variation ("batch-effect"). Supervised principal component survival analysis was employed to identify prognostic models. Models were independently validated in a 61-patient cohort using a custom array genechip and a publicly available 229-array dataset. Molecular correspondence of high- and low-risk outcome groups between training and validation datasets was demonstrated using Subclass Mapping. Previously established molecular phenotypes in the 2(nd) validation set were correlated with high and low-risk outcome groups. Functional representational and pathway analysis was used to explore gene networks associated with high and low risk phenotypes. A 19-gene model showed optimal performance in the training set (median {OS} 31 and 78 months, p {\textless} 0.01), 1(st) validation set (median {OS} 32 months versus not-yet-reached, p = 0.026) and 2(nd) validation set (median {OS} 43 versus 61 months, p = 0.013) maintaining independent prognostic power in multivariate analysis. There was strong molecular correspondence of the respective high- and low-risk tumors between training and 1(st) validation set. Low and high-risk tumors were enriched for favorable and unfavorable molecular subtypes and pathways, previously defined in the public 2(nd) validation set.


{CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}

Integration of previously generated cancer microarray datasets may lead to robust and widely applicable survival predictors. These predictors are not simply a compilation of prognostic genes but appear to track true molecular phenotypes of good- and poor-outcome.},

	abstract = {Given the very substantial heterogeneity of most human cancers, it is likely that most cancer therapeutics will be active in only a small fraction of any population of patients. As such, the development of new therapeutics, coupled with methods to match a therapy with the individual patient, will be critical to achieving significant gains in disease outcome. One such opportunity is the use of expression signatures to identify key oncogenic phenotypes that can serve not only as biomarkers but also as a means of identifying therapeutic compounds that might specifically target these phenotypes. Given the potential importance of targeting tumors exhibiting a stem-like phenotype, we have developed an expression signature that reflects common biological aspects of various stem-like characteristics. The consensus stemness ranking ({CSR}) signature is upregulated in cancer stem cell–enriched samples at advanced tumor stages and is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types. Using two independent computational approaches we utilized the {CSR} signature to identify clinically useful compounds that could target the {CSR} phenotype. In vitro assays confirmed selectivity of several predicted compounds including topoisomerase inhibitors and resveratrol towards breast cancer cell lines that exhibit a high-{CSR} phenotype. Importantly, the {CSR} signature could predict clinical response of breast cancer patients to a neoadjuvant regimen that included a {CSR}-specific agent. Collectively, these results suggest therapeutic opportunities to target the {CSR} phenotype in a relevant cohort of cancer patients. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1772–80. ©2010 {AACR}.},

	abstract = {Within solid tumor microenvironments, lactic acidosis, and hypoxia each have powerful effects on cancer pathophysiology. However, the influence that these processes exert on each other is unknown. Here, we report that a significant portion of the transcriptional response to hypoxia elicited in cancer cells is abolished by simultaneous exposure to lactic acidosis. In particular, lactic acidosis abolished stabilization of {HIF}-1α protein which occurs normally under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, lactic acidosis strongly synergized with hypoxia to activate the unfolded protein response ({UPR}) and an inflammatory response, displaying a strong similarity to {ATF}4-driven amino acid deprivation responses ({AAR}). In certain breast tumors and breast tumor cells examined, an integrative analysis of gene expression and array {CGH} data revealed {DNA} copy number alterations at the {ATF}4 locus, an important activator of the {UPR}/{AAR} pathway. In this setting, varying {ATF}4 levels influenced the survival of cells after exposure to hypoxia and lactic acidosis. Our findings reveal that the condition of lactic acidosis present in solid tumors inhibits canonical hypoxia responses and activates {UPR} and inflammation responses. Furthermore, these data suggest that {ATF}4 status may be a critical determinant of the ability of cancer cells to adapt to oxygen and acidity fluctuations in the tumor microenvironment, perhaps linking short-term transcriptional responses to long-term selection for copy number alterations in cancer cells.

	abstract = {{TPD}52 and {ERBB}2 co-expression has been persistently reported in human breast cancer and animal models of this disease, but the significance of this is unknown. We identified significant positive associations between relative {TPD}52 and {ERBB}2 transcript levels in human diagnostic breast cancer samples, and maximal {TPD}52 expression in the hormone receptor ({HR})- and {ERBB}2-positive sub-group. High-level {TPD}52 expression was associated with significantly reduced metastasis-free survival, within the overall cohort (log rank test, P = 8.6 × 10(-4) , n = 375) where this was an independent predictor of metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.69, 95\% confidence interval 1.59-4.54, P = 2.2 × 10(-4) , n = 359), and the {HR}- and {ERBB}2-positive sub-group (log rank test, P = 0.035, n = 47). Transient {TPD}52 knock-down in the {ERBB}2-amplified breast cancer cell lines {SK}-{BR}-3 and {BT}-474 produced significant apoptosis, both singly and in combination with transient {ERBB}2 knock-down. Unlike {ERBB}2 knock-down, transient {TPD}52 knock-down produced no reduction in {pAKT} levels in {SK}-{BR}-3 or {BT}-474 cells. We then derived multiple {SK}-{BR}-3 cell lines in which {TPD}52 levels were stably reduced, and measured significant inverse correlations between {pERBB}2 and {TPD}52 levels in viable {TPD}52-depleted and control cell lines, all of which showed similar proliferative capacities. Our results therefore identify {TPD}52 as a survival factor in {ERBB}2-amplified breast cancer cells, and suggest complementary cellular functions for {TPD}52 and {ERBB}2. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at advanced stage (67\%) and prospects for significant improvement in survival reside in early diagnosis. Our objective was to validate our array assay for the identification of ovarian cancer based on quantitation of tumor-reactive {IgG}.
{METHODS}: The diagnostic array utilizes specific exosome-derived antigens to detect reactive {IgG} in patients' sera. Specific protein targets were isolated by immunoaffinity from exosomes derived from ovarian tumor cell lines. Sera were obtained from age-matched female volunteers, women with benign ovarian disease and with ovarian cancer. Immunoreactivity was also compared between exosomal proteins and their recombinant counterparts.
{RESULTS}: Sera from ovarian cancer patients exhibited significantly greater immunoreactivities than either normal controls or women with benign disease (both considered negative to all antigens tested). Reactivities with nucleophosmin, cathepsin D, p53, and {SSX} common antigen for patients with all stages of ovarian cancer were significantly higher than for controls and women with benign ovarian disease. Reactivity with placental type alkaline phosphatase, {TAG} 72, survivin, {NY}-{ESO}-1, {GRP}78, and Muc16 ({CA}125) allowed the differentiation between Stage {III}/{IV} and early stage ovarian cancer.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The quantitation of circulating tumor-reactive {IgG} can be used to identify the presence of ovarian cancer. The analyses of {IgG} recognition of specific exosomal antigens allows for the differentiation of women with benign ovarian masses from ovarian cancer, as well as distinguishing early and late stage ovarian cancers. Thus, the quantitative assessment of {IgG} reactive with specific tumor-derived exosomal proteins can be used as diagnostic markers for ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Identifying modules from time series biological data helps us understand biological functionalities of a group of proteins/genes interacting together and how responses of these proteins/genes dynamically change with respect to time. With rapid acquisition of time series biological data from different laboratories or databases, new challenges are posed for the identification task and powerful methods which are able to detect modules with integrative analysis are urgently called for. To accomplish such integrative analysis, we assemble multiple time series biological data into a higher-order form, e.g., a gene × condition × time tensor. It is interesting and useful to develop methods to identify modules from this tensor.
{RESULTS}: In this paper, we present {MultiFacTV}, a new method to find modules from higher-order time series biological data. This method employs a tensor factorization objective function where a time-related total variation regularization term is incorporated. According to factorization results, {MultiFacTV} extracts modules that are composed of some genes, conditions and time-points. We have performed {MultiFacTV} on synthetic datasets and the results have shown that {MultiFacTV} outperforms existing methods {EDISA} and Metafac. Moreover, we have applied {MultiFacTV} to Arabidopsis thaliana root(shoot) tissue dataset represented as a gene × condition × time tensor of size 2395 × 9 × 6(3454 × 8 × 6), to Yeast dataset and Homo sapiens dataset represented as tensors of sizes 4425 × 6 × 6 and 2920 × 14 × 9 respectively. The results have shown that {MultiFacTV} indeed identifies some interesting modules in these datasets, which have been validated and explained by Gene Ontology analysis with {DAVID} or other analysis.
{CONCLUSION}: Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real datasets show that the proposed {MultiFacTV} is effective in identifying modules for higher-order time series biological data. It provides, compared to traditional non-integrative analysis methods, a more comprehensive and better view on biological process since modules composed of more than two types of biological variables could be identified and analyzed.},

We demonstrated this for exosomes of the metastatic rat adenocarcinoma {BSp}73ASML ({ASML}), which modulate draining lymph nodes and lung tissue to support settlement of poorly metastatic {BSp}73ASML-{CD}44v4-v7 knockdown ({ASML}-{CD}44v(kd)) cells. Now, we profiled {mRNA} and {microRNA} ({miRNA}) of {ASML}(wt) and {ASML}-{CD}44v(kd) exosomes to define the pathway(s), whereby exosomes prepare the premetastatic niche. {ASML} exosomes, recovered in draining lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection, preferentially are taken up by lymph node stroma cells ({LnStr}) and lung fibroblasts ({LuFb}) that were chosen as exosome targets. {ASML}(wt) and {ASML}-{CD}44v(kd) exosomes contain a restricted {mRNA} and {miRNA} repertoire that differs significantly between the two lines and exosomes thereof due to {CD}44v6 influencing gene and {miRNA} transcription/posttranscriptional regulation. Exosomal {mRNA} and {miRNA} are recovered in target cells, where transferred {miRNA} significantly affected {mRNA} translation. Besides others, this was exemplified for abundant {ASML}(wt)-exosomal {miR}-494 and {miR}-542-3p, which target cadherin-17 (cdh17). Concomitantly, matrix metalloproteinase transcription, accompanying cdh17 down-regulation, was upregulated in {LnStr} transfected with {miR}-494 or {miR}-542-3p or co-cultured with tumor exosomes. Thus, tumor exosomes target non-transformed cells in premetastatic organs and modulate premetastatic organ cells predominantly through transferred {miRNA}, where {miRNA} from a metastasizing tumor prepares premetastatic organ stroma cells for tumor cell hosting. Fitting the demands of metastasizing tumor cells, transferred exosomal {miRNA} mostly affected proteases, adhesion molecules, chemokine ligands, cell cycle- and angiogenesis-promoting genes, and genes engaged in oxidative stress response. The demonstration of function-competent exosomal {miRNA} in host target cells encourages exploiting exosomes as a therapeutic gene delivery system.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

The five {RPPA}-defined clusters were strongly associated with sensitivity to standard anticancer agents. {RPPA} analysis identified 27 protein features significantly associated with sensitivity to paclitaxel. The functional status of those proteins was interrogated in a paclitaxel whole genome small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) library synthetic lethality screen and confirmed the predicted associations with drug sensitivity.

	issn = {1741-7007},
	doi = {10.1186/1741-7007-8-66},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Phylostratigraphy is a method used to correlate the evolutionary origin of founder genes (that is, functional founder protein domains) of gene families with particular macroevolutionary transitions. It is based on a model of genome evolution that suggests that the origin of complex phenotypic innovations will be accompanied by the emergence of such founder genes, the descendants of which can still be traced in extant organisms. The origin of multicellularity can be considered to be a macroevolutionary transition, for which new gene functions would have been required. Cancer should be tightly connected to multicellular life since it can be viewed as a malfunction of interaction between cells in a multicellular organism. A phylostratigraphic tracking of the origin of cancer genes should, therefore, also provide insights into the origin of multicellularity.


{RESULTS}

We find two strong peaks of the emergence of cancer related protein domains, one at the time of the origin of the first cell and the other around the time of the evolution of the multicellular metazoan organisms. These peaks correlate with two major classes of cancer genes, the 'caretakers', which are involved in general functions that support genome stability and the 'gatekeepers', which are involved in cellular signalling and growth processes. Interestingly, this phylogenetic succession mirrors the ontogenetic succession of tumour progression, where mutations in caretakers are thought to precede mutations in gatekeepers.


{CONCLUSIONS}

A link between multicellularity and formation of cancer has often been predicted. However, this has not so far been explicitly tested. Although we find that a significant number of protein domains involved in cancer predate the origin of multicellularity, the second peak of cancer protein domain emergence is, indeed, connected to a phylogenetic level where multicellular animals have emerged. The fact that we can find a strong and consistent signal for this second peak in the phylostratigraphic map implies that a complex multi-level selection process has driven the transition to multicellularity.},

Such data provide unique opportunities to study the coordination between regulatory mechanisms on multiple levels. However, integrative analysis of multi-dimensional genomics data for the discovery of combinatorial patterns is currently lacking. Here, we adopt a joint matrix factorization technique to address this challenge. This method projects multiple types of genomic data onto a common coordinate system, in which heterogeneous variables weighted highly in the same projected direction form a multi-dimensional module (md-module). Genomic variables in such modules are characterized by significant correlations and likely functional associations. We applied this method to the {DM}, {GE}, and {microRNA} expression data of 385 ovarian cancer samples from the The Cancer Genome Atlas project. These md-modules revealed perturbed pathways that would have been overlooked with only a single type of data, uncovered associations between different layers of cellular activities and allowed the identification of clinically distinct patient subgroups. Our study provides an useful protocol for uncovering hidden patterns and their biological implications in multi-dimensional ‘omic’ data.},

However, each breast cancer subtype is also heterogeneous. Some of the heterogeneity may be attributable to genetic instability, but recent data emphasize that developmental plasticity may also contribute. The p53 tumor suppressor could constitute a nodal control point underlying both sources of heterogeneity because it is frequently inactivated during malignant progression and has recently been shown to function as a potent barrier preventing fully differentiated cells from reverting to pluripotent stem cells after expression of appropriate oncogenes. Using archival microarray datasets, we tested the hypothesis that a p53 mutation could allow cells within a tumor to acquire a stem cell-like state by looking for coordinate expression of stem cell identity genes. We show that breast and lung cancers with p53 mutations do exhibit stem cell-like transcriptional patterns. Such tumors were also depleted for differentiation genes regulated by the polycomb repressor complex 2. These data are consistent with a model in which loss of p53 function enables acquisition of stem cell properties, which are positively selected during tumor progression.},

Therefore, a central challenge in human cancer therapy is the identification of pathways that control tumor cell survival and chemosensitivity in the absence of functional p53. The p53-related transcription factors p63 and p73 exhibit distinct functions—p73 mediates chemosensitivity while p63 promotes proliferation and cell survival—and are both overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas ({SCCs}). However, how p63 and p73 interact functionally and govern the balance between prosurvival and proapoptotic programs in {SCC} remains elusive. Here, we identify a {microRNA}-dependent mechanism of p63/p73 crosstalk that regulates p53-independent survival of both human and murine {SCC}. We first discovered that a subset of p63-regulated {microRNAs} target p73 for inhibition. One of these, {miR}-193a-5p, expression of which was repressed by p63, was activated by proapoptotic p73 isoforms in both normal cells and tumor cells in vivo. Chemotherapy caused p63/p73-dependent induction of this {microRNA}, thereby limiting chemosensitivity due to {microRNA}-mediated feedback inhibition of p73. Importantly, inhibiting {miR}-193a interrupted this feedback and thereby suppressed tumor cell viability and induced dramatic chemosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we have identified a direct, {microRNA}-dependent regulatory circuit mediating inducible chemoresistance, whose inhibition may provide a new therapeutic opportunity in p53-deficient tumors.},

In order to answer this question, we created an extensive resource of protein expression and interactions across 16 main human tissues. Using this resource, we first show that the genes underlying hundreds of hereditary diseases are widely expressed across tissues, yet, enigmatically, cause disease phenotypes in few tissues only. We then identify two distinct, statistically-significant factors that could lead to tissue-specific vulnerability in the face of this broad expression: (i) many disease-causing genes have elevated expression levels in their disease tissues, and (ii) disease-causing genes have a significantly higher tendency for tissue-specific interactions in their disease tissues. As we show for several disease-causing genes, these tissue-specific interactions highlight disease mechanisms and provide an efficient filter for interrogating the molecular basis of diseases. Together the two factors we identified are relevant for as many as two thirds of the tissue-specific hereditary diseases. Our comparative tissue analysis therefore provides a meaningful and efficient framework for enhancing the understanding of the molecular basis of hereditary diseases.},

	abstract = {Here, we show for the first time, that the familial breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene {BRCA}1 activates the Notch pathway in breast cells by transcriptional upregulation of Notch ligands and receptors in both normal and cancer cells. We demonstrate through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that {BRCA}1 is localized to a conserved intronic enhancer region within the Notch ligand Jagged-1 ({JAG}1) gene, an event requiring ΔNp63. We propose that this {BRCA}1/ΔNp63-mediated induction of {JAG}1 may be important the regulation of breast stem/precursor cells, as knockdown of all three proteins resulted in increased tumoursphere growth and increased activity of stem cell markers such as Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 ({ALDH}1). Knockdown of Notch1 and {JAG}1 phenocopied {BRCA}1 knockdown resulting in the loss of Estrogen Receptor-α ({ER}-α) expression and other luminal markers. A Notch mimetic peptide could activate an {ER}-α promoter reporter in a {BRCA}1-dependent manner, whereas Notch inhibition using a γ-secretase inhibitor reversed this process. We demonstrate that inhibition of Notch signalling resulted in decreased sensitivity to the anti-estrogen drug Tamoxifen but increased expression of markers associated with basal-like breast cancer. Together, these findings suggest that {BRCA}1 transcriptional upregulation of Notch signalling is a key event in the normal differentiation process in breast tissue.},

Gene set enrichment analysis ({GSEA}) is a microarray data analysis method that uses predefined gene sets and ranks of genes to identify significant biological changes in microarray data sets. {GSEA} is especially useful when gene expression changes in a given microarray data set is minimal or moderate.


{RESULTS}

We developed a modified gene set enrichment analysis method based on a parametric statistical analysis model. Compared with {GSEA}, the parametric analysis of gene set enrichment ({PAGE}) detected a larger number of significantly altered gene sets and their p-values were lower than the corresponding p-values calculated by {GSEA}. Because {PAGE} uses normal distribution for statistical inference, it requires less computation than {GSEA}, which needs repeated computation of the permutated data set. {PAGE} was able to detect significantly changed gene sets from microarray data irrespective of different Affymetrix probe level analysis methods or different microarray platforms. Comparison of two aged muscle microarray data sets at gene set level using {PAGE} revealed common biological themes better than comparison at individual gene level.


{CONCLUSION}

{PAGE} was statistically more sensitive and required much less computational effort than {GSEA}, it could identify significantly changed biological themes from microarray data irrespective of analysis methods or microarray platforms, and it was useful in comparison of multiple microarray data sets. We offer {PAGE} as a useful microarray analysis method.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma tumour cells release microvesicles (exosomes) containing {mRNA}, {miRNA} and angiogenic proteins. These microvesicles are taken up by normal host cells, such as brain microvascular endothelial cells. By incorporating an {mRNA} for a reporter protein into these microvesicles, we demonstrate that messages delivered by microvesicles are translated by recipient cells. These microvesicles are also enriched in angiogenic proteins and stimulate tubule formation by endothelial cells. Tumour-derived microvesicles therefore serve as a means of delivering genetic information and proteins to recipient cells in the tumour environment. Glioblastoma microvesicles also stimulated proliferation of a human glioma cell line, indicating a self-promoting aspect. Messenger {RNA} mutant/variants and {miRNAs} characteristic of gliomas could be detected in serum microvesicles of glioblastoma patients. The tumour-specific {EGFRvIII} was detected in serum microvesicles from 7 out of 25 glioblastoma patients. Thus, tumour-derived microvesicles may provide diagnostic information and aid in therapeutic decisions for cancer patients through a blood test.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ygyno.2007.08.064},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: {CD}24 is an established marker for poor prognosis in ovarian and other carcinomas. Acquisition of cytoplasmic {CD}24, as opposed to membranous expression, has been correlated with a higher invasiveness of tumor cells. Exosomes are small vesicles of endosomal origin that are often secreted by tumor cells. Given the emerging role of exosomes in tumor progression, we investigated whether cytoplasmic {CD}24 expression is correlated with the secretion of {CD}24 in exosomes.
{METHODS}: We used {CD}24 transfected carcinoma cell lines, ovarian carcinoma cell lines and malignant ascites fluid of ovarian carcinoma patients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation and sucrose density fractionation and subsequently examined by Western blot analysis and gelatine zymography. In tissue sections {CD}24 was detected by immunohistochemical staining.
{RESULTS}: We show that {CD}24 is released by transfected as well as endogenously expressing cells in vesicles that represent exosomes. {CD}24 was also identified in exosomes isolated from ascites fluid of ovarian carcinoma patients. In 16 ovarian carcinomas analyzed no correlation between {CD}24 in tumor tissue sections and the appearance of {CD}24 in exosomes was detected. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the epithelial cell adhesion molecule ({EpCAM}), known to be overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas, is secreted in exosomes. The ascites exosomes contain gelatinolytic enzymes.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our study identifies {CD}24 and {EpCAM} as cargo proteins of exosomes of cultured cell lines and malignant ascites. The exosome-associated proteolytic activity in the tumor vicinity might augment tumor invasion into the stroma.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) regulate target gene expression by controlling their {mRNAs} post-transcriptionally. Increasing evidence demonstrates that {miRNAs} play important roles in various biological processes. However, the functions and precise regulatory mechanisms of most {miRNAs} remain elusive. Current research suggests that {miRNA} regulatory modules are complicated, including up-, down-, and mix-regulation for different physiological conditions. Previous computational approaches for discovering {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions focus only on down-regulatory modules. In this work, we present a method to capture complex {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions including all regulatory types between {miRNAs} and {mRNAs}. {RESULTS} We present a method to capture complex {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions using Bayesian network structure learning with splitting-averaging strategy. It is designed to explore all possible {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions by integrating {miRNA}-targeting information, expression profiles of {miRNAs} and {mRNAs}, and sample categories. We also present an analysis of data sets for epithelial and mesenchymal transition ({EMT}). Our results show that the proposed method identified all possible types of {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions from the data. Many interactions are of tremendous biological significance. Some discoveries have been validated by previous research, for example, the {miR}-200 family negatively regulates {ZEB}1 and {ZEB}2 for {EMT}. Some are consistent with the literature, such as {LOX} has wide interactions with the {miR}-200 family members for {EMT}. Furthermore, many novel interactions are statistically significant and worthy of validation in the near future. {CONCLUSIONS} This paper presents a new method to explore the complex {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions for different physiological conditions using Bayesian network structure learning with splitting-averaging strategy. The method makes use of heterogeneous data including {miRNA}-targeting information, expression profiles of {miRNAs} and {mRNAs}, and sample categories. Results on {EMT} data sets show that the proposed method uncovers many known {miRNA} targets as well as new potentially promising {miRNA}-{mRNA} interactions. These interactions could not be achieved by the normal Bayesian network structure learning.},

	abstract = {Invasive lobular breast cancer ({ILC}) accounts for 10-15\% of all invasive breast carcinomas. It is generally {ER} positive ({ER}+) and often associated with lobular carcinoma in situ ({LCIS}). Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 70 common polymorphisms that predispose to breast cancer, but these studies included predominantly ductal ({IDC}) carcinomas. To identify novel common polymorphisms that predispose to {ILC} and {LCIS}, we pooled data from 6,023 cases (5,622 {ILC}, 401 pure {LCIS}) and 34,271 controls from 36 studies genotyped using the {iCOGS} chip. Six novel {SNPs} most strongly associated with {ILC}/{LCIS} in the pooled analysis were genotyped in a further 516 lobular cases (482 {ILC}, 36 {LCIS}) and 1,467 controls. These analyses identified a lobular-specific {SNP} at 7q34 (rs11977670, {OR} (95\%{CI}) for {ILC} = 1.13 (1.09-1.18), P = 6.0 × 10(-10); P-het for {ILC} vs {IDC} {ER}+ tumors = 1.8 × 10(-4)). Of the 75 known breast cancer polymorphisms that were genotyped, 56 were associated with {ILC} and 15 with {LCIS} at P{\textless}0.05. Two {SNPs} showed significantly stronger associations for {ILC} than {LCIS} (rs2981579/10q26/{FGFR}2, P-het = 0.04 and rs889312/5q11/{MAP}3K1, P-het = 0.03); and two showed stronger associations for {LCIS} than {ILC} (rs6678914/1q32/{LGR}6, P-het = 0.001 and rs1752911/6q14, P-het = 0.04). In addition, seven of the 75 known loci showed significant differences between {ER}+ tumors with {IDC} and {ILC} histology, three of these showing stronger associations for {ILC} (rs11249433/1p11, rs2981579/10q26/{FGFR}2 and rs10995190/10q21/{ZNF}365) and four associated only with {IDC} (5p12/rs10941679; rs2588809/14q24/{RAD}51L1, rs6472903/8q21 and rs1550623/2q31/{CDCA}7). In conclusion, we have identified one novel lobular breast cancer specific predisposition polymorphism at 7q34, and shown for the first time that common breast cancer polymorphisms predispose to {LCIS}. We have shown that many of the {ER}+ breast cancer predisposition loci also predispose to {ILC}, although there is some heterogeneity between {ER}+ lobular and {ER}+ {IDC} tumors. These data provide evidence for overlapping, but distinct etiological pathways within {ER}+ breast cancer between morphological subtypes.},

In this study, we generate a set of simulated microarray datasets to compare gene selection/ranking rules, including P-value, {FC} and their combinations, using the percentage of overlapping genes between {DEGs} from two similar simulated datasets as the measure of reproducibility. The results are supportive of the {MAQC}'s conclusion on that {DEG} lists are more reproducible across laboratories and platforms when {FC}-based ranking coupled with a nonstringent P-value cutoff is used for gene selection compared with selection based on P-value based ranking method.

It is now clear that stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment play an important role in cancer development. Molecular events through which reactive stromal cells affect cancer cells can be defined so that biomarkers and therapeutic targets can be identified. Cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}) make up the bulk of cancer stroma and affect the tumor microenvironment such that they promote cancer initiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. In breast cancer, {CAFs} not only promote tumor progression but also induce therapeutic resistance. Accordingly, targeting {CAFs} provides a novel way to control tumors with therapeutic resistance. This review summarizes the current understandings of tumor stroma in breast cancer with a particular emphasis on the role of {CAFs} and the therapeutic implications of {CAFs}. In addition, the effects of other stromal components such as endothelial cells, macrophages, and adipocytes in breast cancer are also discussed.

Typical examples are infectious diseases or immunology-related studies using blood samples, where, for example, the proportions of lymphocyte sub-populations are expected to vary between cases and controls. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization ({NMF}) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, notably in bioinformatics where its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays has been demonstrated. Very recently, it has been applied to biomarker discovery and gene expression deconvolution in heterogeneous tissue samples. Being essentially unsupervised, standard {NMF} methods are not guaranteed to find components corresponding to the cell types of interest in the sample, which may jeopardize the correct estimation of cell proportions. We have investigated the use of prior knowledge, in the form of a set of marker genes, to improve gene expression deconvolution with {NMF} algorithms. We found that this improves the consistency with which both cell type proportions and cell type gene expression signatures are estimated. The proposed method was tested on a microarray dataset consisting of pure cell types mixed in known proportions. Pearson correlation coefficients between true and estimated cell type proportions improved substantially (typically from about 0.5 to approximately 0.8) with the semi-supervised (marker-guided) versions of commonly used {NMF} algorithms. Furthermore known marker genes associated with each cell type were assigned to the correct cell type more frequently for the guided versions. We conclude that the use of marker genes improves the accuracy of gene expression deconvolution using {NMF} and suggest modifications to how the marker gene information is used that may lead to further improvements.},

Cells exchange information through a multitude of mechanisms such as secreted growth factors and chemokines, small molecules (peptides, ions, bioactive lipids and nucleotides), cell-cell contact and the secretion of extracellular matrix components. Over the last few years, however, a considerable amount of experimental evidence has demonstrated the occurrence of a sophisticated method of cell communication based on the release of specialized membranous nano-sized vesicles termed exosomes. Exosome biogenesis involves the endosomal compartment, the multivesicular bodies ({MVB}), which contain internal vesicles packed with an extraordinary set of molecules including enzymes, cytokines, nucleic acids and different bioactive compounds. In response to stimuli, {MVB} fuse with the plasma membrane and vesicles are released in the extracellular space where they can interact with neighboring cells and directly induce a signaling pathway or affect the cellular phenotype through the transfer of new receptors or even genetic material.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIMS}

Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript ({CART}) is an anorexigenic regulatory peptide highly expressed in the brain's appetite control centers, but also in peripheral neurons and in endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla, thyroid, pancreatic islets, and in the gastrointestinal tract. Plasma levels of {CART} were recently shown to be elevated in patients with neuroendocrine tumors ({NETs}), but the cellular sources of {CART} in {NETs} have remained unknown. The aim of the study was to establish whether {CART} is expressed in various types of {NETs} and, if so, to examine the frequency, distribution and phenotype of {CART}-expressing cells.


{METHODS}

Tumor specimens from 133 {NETs} originating in the stomach, ileum, rectum, pancreas and thyroid were examined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The expression of {CART} was quantified and the {CART}-expressing cells were phenotyped by double staining for established markers and hormones.


{RESULTS}

{CART}-expressing tumor cells were found in the majority of the examined {NETs}. The expression pattern of {CART} was highly heterogeneous not only between tumors, but also within individual tumors. In 14\% of the {NETs}, {CART} was found in a major population of the tumor cells.


{CONCLUSION}

{CART} is produced in the majority of {NETs}, regardless of tumor origin. This likely explains the elevated levels of circulating {CART} in certain {NETs} patients, as recently described. {CART} could therefore prove to be a useful tool in the diagnostics of {NETs} not only in blood samples, but also in histopathological specimens.},

	abstract = {Tumor exosomes educate selected host tissues toward a prometastatic phenotype. We demonstrated this for exosomes of the metastatic rat adenocarcinoma {BSp}73ASML ({ASML}), which modulate draining lymph nodes and lung tissue to support settlement of poorly metastatic {BSp}73ASML-{CD}44v4-v7 knockdown ({ASML}-{CD}44v(kd)) cells. Now, we profiled {mRNA} and {microRNA} ({miRNA}) of {ASML}(wt) and {ASML}-{CD}44v(kd) exosomes to define the pathway(s), whereby exosomes prepare the premetastatic niche. {ASML} exosomes, recovered in draining lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection, preferentially are taken up by lymph node stroma cells ({LnStr}) and lung fibroblasts ({LuFb}) that were chosen as exosome targets. {ASML}(wt) and {ASML}-{CD}44v(kd) exosomes contain a restricted {mRNA} and {miRNA} repertoire that differs significantly between the two lines and exosomes thereof due to {CD}44v6 influencing gene and {miRNA} transcription/posttranscriptional regulation. Exosomal {mRNA} and {miRNA} are recovered in target cells, where transferred {miRNA} significantly affected {mRNA} translation. Besides others, this was exemplified for abundant {ASML}(wt)-exosomal {miR}-494 and {miR}-542-3p, which target cadherin-17 (cdh17). Concomitantly, matrix metalloproteinase transcription, accompanying cdh17 down-regulation, was upregulated in {LnStr} transfected with {miR}-494 or {miR}-542-3p or co-cultured with tumor exosomes. Thus, tumor exosomes target non-transformed cells in premetastatic organs and modulate premetastatic organ cells predominantly through transferred {miRNA}, where {miRNA} from a metastasizing tumor prepares premetastatic organ stroma cells for tumor cell hosting. Fitting the demands of metastasizing tumor cells, transferred exosomal {miRNA} mostly affected proteases, adhesion molecules, chemokine ligands, cell cycle- and angiogenesis-promoting genes, and genes engaged in oxidative stress response. The demonstration of function-competent exosomal {miRNA} in host target cells encourages exploiting exosomes as a therapeutic gene delivery system.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}
Brain metastases ({BM}) arising from triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}) portend a poor prognosis. {TNBC} is more common in premenopausal and African-American ({AA}) patients; both of these characteristics also confer a poor prognosis. In a single-institution cohort study, the authors attempted to determine whether the inferior outcome noted with {TNBC} brain metastases is more reflective of a higher risk population or the subtype itself.

{METHODS}
The University of North Carolina Breast Cancer Database identified patients with {BC} brain metastases who were diagnosed between 1988 and 2008. {BC} subtype was assigned by immunohistochemistry: hormone receptor ({HR}) positive (+);({HR}, estrogen receptor [{ER}]+ and/or progesterone receptor [{PR}]+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2) negative (-), {HR}+/{HER}2+, {HR}-/{HER}2+, and {TN} ({ER}-/{PR}-/{HER}2-). Survival and disease recurrence patterns were evaluated by subtype, patient age (\&lt;40 years vs ≥40 years), and race ({AA} vs non-{AA}) using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.

{RESULTS}
Among 119 patients with {BC} brain metastases, 33\% were {AA} and 31\% were aged \&lt;40 years. {BC} subtype was confirmed in 98 patients (30\% with {HR}+/{HER}2-, 21\% with {HR}+/{HER}2+, 18\% with {HR}-/{HER}2+, and 31\% with {TNBC}). Survival after {BM} was found to be impacted by subtype (P = .002), and was shortest for patients with {TNBC} (0.24 years; 95\% confidence interval, 0.17 years-0.48 years). There were no age-specific (P = .84) or race-specific (P = .09) differences in survival noted after brain metastases; stratification of {BC} subtypes by age and race revealed no difference (all, P \&gt; .1). The receipt of systemic therapy after {BC} brain metastases was found to be an important predictor of survival after {BC} brain metastases (hazard ratio, 0.29; P = .002) when adjusted for race, age, number of central nervous system lesions, and {BC} subtype.

{CONCLUSIONS}
{TNBC} confers a high risk of death after brain metastases regardless of patient race and age, supporting the need for novel agents capable of controlling both intracranial and extracranial {TNBC} across all races and ages.},

	abstract = {Background
Metastatic brain tumours are a common end stage of breast cancer progression, with significant associated morbidity and high mortality. Walker 256 is a rat breast carcinoma cell line syngeneic to Wistar rats and commonly used to induce secondary brain tumours. Previously there has been the assumption that the same cancer cell line from different cell banks behave in a similar manner, although recent studies have suggested that cell lines may change their characteristics over time in vitro.

Methods
In this study internal carotid artery injection and direct cerebral inoculation models of secondary brain tumours were used to determine the tumorigenicity of Walker 256 cells obtained from two cell banks, the American Type Culture Collection ({ATCC}), and the Cell Resource Centre for Medical Research at Tohoku University ({CRCTU}).

Results
Tumour incidence and volume, plus immunoreactivity to albumin, {IBA}1 and {GFAP}, were used as indicators of tumorigenicity and tumour interaction with the host brain microenvironment. {CRCTU} Walker 256 cells showed greater incidence, larger tumour volume, pronounced blood–brain barrier disruption and prominent glial response when compared to {ATCC} cell line.

Conclusions
These findings indicate that immortalised cancer cell lines obtained from different cell banks may have diverse characteristics and behaviour in vivo.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} In cancer, gene networks and pathways often exhibit dynamic behavior, particularly during the process of carcinogenesis. Thus, it is important to prioritize those genes that are strongly associated with the functionality of a network. Traditional statistical methods are often inept to identify biologically relevant member genes, motivating researchers to incorporate biological knowledge into gene ranking methods. However, current integration strategies are often heuristic and fail to incorporate fully the true interplay between biological knowledge and gene expression data. {RESULTS} To improve knowledge-guided gene ranking, we propose a novel method called coordinative component analysis ({COCA}) in this paper. {COCA} explicitly captures those genes within a specific biological context that are likely to be expressed in a coordinative manner. Formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the coordinative effort, {COCA} is designed to first extract the coordinative components based on a partial guidance from knowledge genes and then rank the genes according to their participation strengths. An embedded bootstrapping procedure is implemented to improve statistical robustness of the solutions. {COCA} was initially tested on simulation data and then on published gene expression microarray data to demonstrate its improved performance as compared to traditional statistical methods. Finally, the {COCA} approach has been applied to stem cell data to identify biologically relevant genes in signaling pathways. As a result, the {COCA} approach uncovers novel pathway members that may shed light into the pathway deregulation in cancers. {CONCLUSION} We have developed a new integrative strategy to combine biological knowledge and microarray data for gene ranking. The method utilizes knowledge genes for a guidance to first extract coordinative components, and then rank the genes according to their contribution related to a network or pathway. The experimental results show that such a knowledge-guided strategy can provide context-specific gene ranking with an improved performance in pathway member identification.},

However, it remains a mystery how aquaporin-2 (an integral membrane protein) and other apical transporters are delivered to the urine. Here we address the hypothesis that these proteins reach the urine through the secretion of exosomes [membrane vesicles that originate as internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies ({MVBs})]. Low-density urinary membrane vesicles from normal human subjects were isolated by differential centrifugation. {ImmunoGold} electron microscopy using antibodies directed to cytoplasmic or anticytoplasmic epitopes revealed that the vesicles are oriented "cytoplasmic-side inward," consistent with the unique orientation of exosomes. The vesicles were small ({\textless}100 nm), consistent with studies of {MVBs} and exosomes from other tissues. Proteomic analysis of urinary vesicles through nanospray liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified numerous protein components of {MVBs} and of the endosomal pathway in general. Full liquid chromatography-tandem {MS} analysis revealed 295 proteins, including multiple protein products of genes already known to be responsible for renal and systemic diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Gitelman syndrome, Bartter syndrome, autosomal recessive syndrome of osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis, and familial renal hypomagnesemia.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}

Copy number alterations ({CNAs}) associated with cancer are known to contribute to genomic instability and gene deregulation. Integrating {CNAs} with gene expression helps to elucidate the mechanisms by which {CNAs} act and to identify the transcriptional downstream targets of {CNAs}. Such analyses can help to sort functional driver events from the many accompanying passenger alterations. However, the way {CNAs} affect gene expression can vary in different cellular contexts, for example between different subtypes of the same cancer. Thus, it is important to develop computational approaches capable of inferring differential connectivity of regulatory networks in different cellular contexts.


{RESULTS}

We propose a statistical deregulation model that integrates copy number and expression data of different disease subtypes to jointly model common and differential regulatory relationships. Our model not only identifies {CNAs} driving gene expression changes, but at the same time also predicts differences in regulation that distinguish one cancer subtype from the other. We implement our model in a penalized regression framework and demonstrate in a simulation study the feasibility and accuracy of our approach. Subsequently, we show that this model can identify both known and novel aspects of cross-talk between the {ER} and {NOTCH} pathways in {ER}-negative-specific deregulations, when compared with {ER}-positive breast cancer. This flexible model can be applied on other modalities such as methylation or {microRNA} and expression to disentangle cancer signaling pathways.

	abstract = {Although the capability of {DNA} to form a variety of non-canonical (non-B) structures has long been recognized, the overall significance of these alternate conformations in biology has only recently become accepted en masse. In order to provide access to genome-wide locations of these classes of predicted structures, we have developed non-B {DB}, a database integrating annotations and analysis of non-B {DNA}-forming sequence motifs. The database provides the most complete list of alternative {DNA} structure predictions available, including Z-{DNA} motifs, quadruplex-forming motifs, inverted repeats, mirror repeats and direct repeats and their associated subsets of cruciforms, triplex and slipped structures, respectively. The database also contains motifs predicted to form static {DNA} bends, short tandem repeats and homo(purine•pyrimidine) tracts that have been associated with disease. The database has been built using the latest releases of the human, chimp, dog, macaque and mouse genomes, so that the results can be compared directly with other data sources. In order to make the data interpretable in a genomic context, features such as genes, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and repetitive elements ({SINE}, {LINE}, etc.) have also been incorporated. The database is accessed through query pages that produce results with links to the {UCSC} browser and a {GBrowse}-based genomic viewer. It is freely accessible at http://nonb.abcc.ncifcrf.gov.},

This review article covers risk factors for the development of ovarian cancer, current detection strategies, prognostic markers, treatment strategies, etiology of tumorigenesis, and ovarian somatic stem cells. While the etiology of ovarian cancer is still unknown, several theories have been proposed as the mechanism of carcinogenesis. One theory states that the surface epithelium undergoing invagination and forming inclusion cysts that are exposed to growth factors and cytokines. The "gonadotropin theory" has also been proposed. Other reigning models for tumorigenesis include the stochastical model where a distinct population of cells acquires somatic mutations leading to metastasis, and the hierarchical model where the tumor is initiated by cancer stem cells ({CSCs}). {CSCs} isolated from primary tumors have the ability to regenerate the tumor and reconstitute the original tumor phenotype with as few as 100 cells. {CSCs} from ovarian carcinomas display the cell surface markers {CD}44+{CD}117+{CD}133+. {CSCs} are also thought to account for chemotherapy resistance through the expression of highly selective transporters {ABCG}2 and {MDR}1 and activation of {TLR}4/{MyD}88. The side population has been characterized by their ability to efflux lipophilic substrates, including the dye Hoechst 33342 and many chemotherapy agents.

	abstract = {One of the major limitations of studying cancer-bone metastasis has been the lack of an appropriate ex-vivo model which can be used under defined conditions that simulates closely the in vivo live bone microenvironment in response to cancer-bone interactions. We have developed and utilized a three-dimensional (3D) cancer-bone metastasis model using free-floating live mouse calvarial bone organs in the presence of cancer cells in a roller tube system. In such co-cultures under hypoxia and a specifically defined bone remodeling stage, viz., resorption system, cancer cells showed a remarkable affinity and specificity for the "endosteal side" of the bone where they colonize and proliferate. This was concurrent with differentiation of resident stem/progenitor cells to osteoclasts and bone resorption. In contrast, under bone formation conditions this model revealed different pathophysiology where the breast cancer cells continued to induce osteoclastic bone resorption whereas prostate cancer cells led to osteoblastic bone formation. The current 3D model was used to demonstrate its application to studies involving chemical and biochemical perturbations in the absence and presence of cancer cells and cellular responses. We describe proof-of-principle with examples of the broad versatility and multi-faceted application of this model that adds another dimension to the ongoing studies in the cancer-bone metastasis arena.},

	abstract = {Luminal breast cancer is the most frequently encountered type of human breast cancer and accounts for half of all breast cancer deaths due to metastatic disease. We have developed new in vivo models of disseminated human luminal breast cancer that closely mimic the human disease. From initial lesions in the tibia, locoregional metastases develop predictably along the iliac and retroperitoneal lymph node chains. Tumors cells retain their epithelioid phenotype throughout the process of dissemination. In addition, systemically injected metastatic {MCF}-7 cells consistently give rise to metastases in the skeleton, floor of mouth, adrenal glands, as well as in the lungs, liver, brain and mammary fat pad. We show that growth of luminal breast cancer metastases is highly dependent on estrogen in a dose-dependent manner and that estrogen withdrawal induces rapid growth arrest of metastatic disease. On the other hand, even though micrometastases at secondary sites remain viable in the absence of estrogen, they are dormant and do not progress to macrometastases. Thus, homing to and seeding of secondary sites do not require estrogen. Moreover, in sharp contrast to basal-like breast cancer metastasis in which transforming growth factor-β signaling plays a key role, luminal breast cancer metastasis is independent of this cytokine. These findings have important implications for the development of targeted anti-metastatic therapy for luminal breast cancer.},

	shorttitle = {Distinct distribution and prognostic significance of molecular subtypes of breast cancer in Chinese women},
	abstract = {Background
Molecular classification of breast cancer is an important prognostic factor. The distribution of molecular subtypes of breast cancer and their prognostic value has not been well documented in Asians.

Methods
A total of 2,791 breast cancer patients recruited for a population-based cohort study were evaluated for molecular subtypes of breast cancer by immunohistochemical assays. Data on clinicopathological characteristics were confirmed by centralized pathology review. The average follow-up of the patients was 53.4 months. Overall and disease-free survival by molecular subtypes of breast cancer were evaluated.

Results
The prevalence of the luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2), and triple-negative subtypes were 48.6\%, 16.7\%, 13.7\%, and 12.9\%, respectively. The luminal A subtype was more likely to be diagnosed in older women (P = 0.03) and had a stronger correlation with favorable clinicopathological factors (smaller tumor size, lower histologic grade, and earlier {TNM} stage) than the triple-negative or {HER}2 subtypes. Women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher frequency of family history of breast cancer than women with other subtypes (P = 0.048). The 5-year overall/disease-free survival percentages for the luminal A, luminal B, {HER}2, and triple-negative subtypes were 92.9\%/88.6\%, 88.6\%/85.1\%, 83.2\%/79.1\%, and 80.7\%/76.0\%, respectively. A similar pattern was observed in multivariate analyses. Immunotherapy was associated with improved overall and disease-free survival for luminal A breast cancer, but reduced disease-free survival ({HR} = 2.21, 95\% {CI}, 1.09-4.48) for the {HER}2 subtype of breast cancer.

Conclusions
The triple-negative and {HER}2 subtypes were associated with poorer outcomes compared with the luminal A subtype among these Chinese women. The {HER}2 subtype was more prevalent in this Chinese population compared with Western populations, suggesting the importance of standardized {HER}2 detection and anti-{HER}2 therapy to potentially benefit a high proportion of breast cancer patients in China.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Accurate evaluation of the quality of genomic or proteomic data and computational methods is vital to our ability to use them for formulating novel biological hypotheses and directing further experiments. There is currently no standard approach to evaluation in functional genomics. Our analysis of existing approaches shows that they are inconsistent and contain substantial functional biases that render the resulting evaluations misleading both quantitatively and qualitatively. These problems make it essentially impossible to compare computational methods or large-scale experimental datasets and also result in conclusions that generalize poorly in most biological applications. {RESULTS}: We reveal issues with current evaluation methods here and suggest new approaches to evaluation that facilitate accurate and representative characterization of genomic methods and data. Specifically, we describe a functional genomics gold standard based on curation by expert biologists and demonstrate its use as an effective means of evaluation of genomic approaches. Our evaluation framework and gold standard are freely available to the community through our website. {CONCLUSION}: Proper methods for evaluating genomic data and computational approaches will determine how much we, as a community, are able to learn from the wealth of available data. We propose one possible solution to this problem here but emphasize that this topic warrants broader community discussion.},

Although the {STAT}3 signaling pathway is a potential drug target, clinical, pathologic, molecular or prognostic features of {STAT}3-activated colorectal cancer remain uncertain. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Utilizing a database of 724 colon and rectal cancer cases, we evaluated phosphorylated {STAT}3 (p-{STAT}3) expression by immunohistochemistry.

The purpose of this study was to determine if changes in telomere length occur in serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma ({STIC}), the putative precursor of "ovarian" high-grade serous carcinoma ({HGSC}). Twenty-two {STICs} from 15 patients with concurrent but discrete {HGSCs} were analyzed for telomere length on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections by conducting p53 immunofluorescence to assist in identifying {STICs} and telomere-specific {FISH}. Telomere length (short, long, or no change) in {STICs} was compared with {HGSCs} using normal fallopian tube epithelium and stromal cells as controls. We found that {STICs} had the shortest telomeres, as 18 (82\%) of 22 {STICs} had short telomeres, whereas only 2 (9\%) showed no change and 2 (9\%) had long telomeres compared with the normal-looking tubal epithelium. In contrast, among 12 paired {HGSCs} and {STICs}, 6 {HGSCs} showed an increase in telomere length, one showed a decrease in length and 5 did not show any change when compared with their matched {STICs}, although, such as {STICs}, the majority of {HGSCs} had shorter telomeres than the associated normal tubal epithelial cells. These differences in telomere length between normal tubal epithelial cells and {STICs}, and between {STICs} and {HGSCs} were statisticaly significant (P{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, the finding of short telomeres, which have been shown to be one of the earliest molecular changes in carcinogenesis, in a vast majority of {STICs} provides further support to the proposal that {STICs} are precursors of {HGSC} and opens new areas of research in elucidating the early events of ovarian high-grade serous carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Pharmacological approaches to treat breast cancer metastases in the brain have been met with limited success. In part, the impermeability of the blood brain barrier ({BBB}) has hindered delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to metastatic tumors in the brain. {BBB}-permeable chemotherapeutic drugs are being developed, and noninvasively assessing the efficacy of these agents will be important in both preclinical and clinical settings. In this regard, dynamic contrast enhanced ({DCE}) and diffusion weighted imaging ({DWI}) are magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) techniques to monitor tumor vascular permeability and cellularity, respectively. In a rat model of metastatic breast cancer, we demonstrate that brain and bone metastases develop with distinct physiological characteristics as measured with {MRI}. Specifically, brain metastases have limited permeability of the {BBB} as assessed with {DCE} and an increased apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC}) measured with {DWI} compared to the surrounding brain. Microscopically, brain metastases were highly infiltrative, grew through vessel co-option, and caused extensive edema and injury to the surrounding neurons and their dendrites. By comparison, metastases situated in the leptomenengies or in the bone had high vascular permeability and significantly lower {ADC} values suggestive of hypercellularity. On histological examination, tumors in the bone and leptomenengies were solid masses with distinct tumor margins. The different characteristics of these tissue sites highlight the influence of the microenvironment on metastatic tumor growth. In light of these results, the suitability of {DWI} and {DCE} to evaluate the response of chemotherapeutic and anti-angiogenic agents used to treat co-opted brain metastases, respectively, remains a formidable challenge.},

	abstract = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAF}) regulate tumor progression, but their role in cancer metastasis remains largely unexplored. Exosomes are secreted microvesicles that are emerging as potent mediators of cell–cell communication that are of particular importance in tumor–stroma interactions. The Wnt-planar cell polarity ({PCP}) pathway is the primary regulator of convergent extension cell movements during vertebrate development, but the role of this signaling pathway in cancer cell migration and metastasis has been unclear. Recently, we revealed that fibroblasts secrete exosomes that promote breast cancer cell ({BCC}) protrusive activity, motility, and metastasis by activating autocrine Wnt-{PCP} signaling in {BCCs}. Moreover, we showed that Wnt ligands produced by {BCCs} tether to fibroblast exosomes upon trafficking of exosomes in {BCCs}. These findings have several implications that motivate promising future research in the fields of tumor–stroma communication, exosome function, and Wnt-{PCP} signaling in cancer metastasis.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

A novel method of microarray preprocessing--Frozen Robust Multi-array Analysis ({fRMA})--has recently been developed. This algorithm allows the user to preprocess arrays individually while retaining the advantages of multi-array preprocessing methods. The frozen parameter estimates required by this algorithm are generated using a large database of publicly available arrays. Curation of such a database and creation of the frozen parameter estimates is time-consuming; therefore, {fRMA} has only been implemented on the most widely used Affymetrix platforms.


{RESULTS}

We present an R package, {frmaTools}, that allows the user to quickly create his or her own frozen parameter vectors. We describe how this package fits into a preprocessing workflow and explore the size of the training dataset needed to generate reliable frozen parameter estimates. This is followed by a discussion of specific situations in which one might wish to create one's own {fRMA} implementation. For a few specific scenarios, we demonstrate that {fRMA} performs well even when a large database of arrays in unavailable.


{CONCLUSIONS}

By allowing the user to easily create his or her own {fRMA} implementation, the {frmaTools} package greatly increases the applicability of the {fRMA} algorithm. The {frmaTools} package is freely available as part of the Bioconductor project.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Gene expression signatures have been identified for epithelial ovarian cancer survival ({TCGA}) and intrinsic subtypes (Tothill et al.). One obstacle to clinical translation is that these signatures were developed using frozen tissue, whereas usually only formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded ({FFPE}) tissue is available. The aim of this study was to determine if gene expression signatures can be translated to fixed archival tissues.
{METHODS}: {RNA} extracted from {FFPE} sections from 240 primary ovarian cancers was analyzed by {DASL} on Illumina {BeadChip} arrays. Concordance of expression at the individual gene level was assessed by comparing array data from the same cancers (30 frozen samples analyzed on Affymetrix arrays versus {FFPE} {DASL}).
{RESULTS}: The correlation between {FFPE} and frozen survival signature estimates was 0.774. The {TCGA} signature using {DASL} was predictive of survival in 106 advanced stage high grade serous ovarian cancers (median survival 33 versus 60 months, estimated hazard ratio for death 2.30, P=0.0007). Similar to Tothill, we found using {DASL} that most high grade serous ovarian cancers (102/110, 93\%) were assigned to subtypes 1, 2, 4 and 5, whereas most endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous and low grade serous cases (39/57, 68\%) were assigned to subtypes 3 and 6 (P{\textless}10e-15).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although individual probe estimates of microarrays may be weakly correlated between {FFPE} and frozen samples, combinations of probes have robust ability to predict survival and subtype. This suggests that it may be possible to use these signatures for prognostic and predictive purposes as we seek to individualize the treatment of ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles of endocytic origin that are involved in cell-to-cell communication including shuttle {RNA}, mainly {mRNA} and {microRNA}. As exosomes naturally carry {RNA} between cells, these particles might be useful in gene cancer therapy to deliver therapeutic short interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) to the target cells. Despite the promise of {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) for use in therapy, several technical obstacles must be overcome. Exogenous {siRNA} is prone to degradation, has a limited ability to cross cell membranes and may induce an immune response. Naturally occurring {RNA} carriers, such as exosomes, might provide an untapped source of effective delivery strategies.
{RESULTS}: This study demonstrates that exosomes can deliver {siRNA} to recipient cells in vitro. The different strategies were used to introduce {siRNAs} into human exosomes of various origins. The delivery of fluorescently labeled {siRNA} via exosomes to cells was confirmed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Two different {siRNAs} against {RAD}51 and {RAD}52 were used to transfect into the exosomes for therapeutic delivery into target cells. The exosome-delivered {siRNAs} were effective at causing post-transcriptional gene silencing in recipient cells. Moreover, the exosome-delivered {siRNA} against {RAD}51 was functional and caused the massive reproductive cell death of recipient cancer cells.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results strongly suggest that exosomes effectively delivered the {siRNA} into the target cells. The therapeutic potential of exosome-mediated {siRNA} delivery was demonstrated in vitro by the strong knockdown of {RAD}51, a prospective therapeutic target for cancer cells. The results give an additional evidence of the ability to use human exosomes as vectors in cancer therapy, including {RNAi}-based gene therapy.},

Although myriad independent studies have profiled the global effects of this hormone on gene expression in these cells, disparate experimental variables and the limited power of the individual studies have combined to restrict the agreement between them as to the specific gene expression signature elicited by this hormone. To address these issues, we have developed a freely accessible Web resource, Gene Expression {MetaSignatures} ({GEMS}) that provides the user a consensus for each gene in the system. We conducted a weighted meta-analysis encompassing over 13,000 genes across 10 independent published datasets addressing the effect of 17beta-estradiol on {MCF}-7 cells at early (3-4 hours) and late (24 hours) time points. In a literature survey of 58 genes previously shown to be regulated by 17beta-estradiol in {MCF}-7 cells, the meta-analysis combined the statistical power of the underlying datasets to call regulation of these genes with nearly 85\% accuracy (false discovery rate-corrected P {\textless} 0.05).

The {PathOlogist} is a new tool designed to transform large sets of gene expression data into quantitative descriptors of pathway-level behavior. The tool aims to provide a robust alternative to the search for single-gene-to-phenotype associations by accounting for the complexity of molecular interactions.

Results
Molecular abundance data is used to calculate two metrics - 'activity' and 'consistency' - for each pathway in a set of more than 500 canonical molecular pathways (source: Pathway Interaction Database, http://pid.nci.nih.gov). The tool then allows a detailed exploration of these metrics through integrated visualization of pathway components and structure, hierarchical clustering of pathways and samples, and statistical analyses designed to detect associations between pathway behavior and clinical features.

Conclusions
The {PathOlogist} provides a straightforward means to identify the functional processes, rather than individual molecules, that are altered in disease. The statistical power and biologic significance of this approach are made easily accessible to laboratory researchers and informatics analysts alike. Here we show as an example, how the {PathOlogist} can be used to establish pathway signatures that robustly differentiate breast cancer cell lines based on response to treatment.},

However, the diversity of platforms has made it a challenge to re-use and/or integrate datasets generated in different experiments or labs for constructing array-based diagnostic models. Using large toxicogenomics datasets generated using both Affymetrix and Agilent microarray platforms, we carried out a benchmark evaluation of cross-platform consistency in multiple-class prediction using three widely-used machine learning algorithms. After an initial assessment of model performance on different platforms, we evaluated whether predictive signature features selected in one platform could be directly used to train a model in the other platform and whether predictive models trained using data from one platform could predict datasets profiled using the other platform with comparable performance. Our results established that it is possible to successfully apply multiple-class prediction models across different commercial microarray platforms, offering a number of important benefits such as accelerating the possible translation of biomarkers identified with microarrays to clinically-validated assays. However, this investigation focuses on a technical platform comparison and is actually only the beginning of exploring cross-platform consistency.

According to St Gallen conference consensus 2011, its {BC} approximations were applied to classify {BC} into five subtypes: estrogen receptor ({ER}) and/or progesterone receptor ({PgR}) positive, {HER}2 negative, and low Ki67 ({\textless}14\%) [luminal A]; {ER} and/or {PgR} positive, {HER}2 negative and high Ki67(≥ 14\%) [luminal B/{HER}2 negative]; {ER} and/or {PgR} positive, any Ki67 and {HER}2 positive [luminal B/{HER}2 positive]; {ER} negative, {PgR} negative and {HER}2 positive [{HER}2 positive/nonluminal]; and {ER} negative, {PgR} negative and {HER}2 negative [triple negative]. Cumulative incidences of {LRR} were compared across different subgroups by means of the Gray test. Multivariable Cox regression models were applied.
{RESULTS}: Median follow up time was 74 months (range 3-165). The cumulative incidence of {LRR} was 5.5\% (121 events). The 5-year cumulative incidence of {LRR} was 2.5\% for luminal A; 5.0\% for luminal B/{HER}2 negative; 9.8\% for luminal B/{HER}2 positive; 3.8\% for {HER}2 non luminal; and 10.9\% for triple negative. On multivariable analysis, tumor size ({pT}) {\textgreater}2 cm, body mass index ({BMI}) ≥ 25, triple negative and luminal B/{HER}2 positive subtypes were associated with increased risk of {LRR}.

While the fact that sequence similarity implies functional similarity is a fundamental paradigm of molecular biology, sequence comparison does not directly assess the extent to which two proteins participate in the same biological processes, and has limited utility for analyzing families with several parologous members. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to provide a cross-organism functional similarity measure in an unbiased way through the exclusive use of high-throughput gene-expression data. Our methodology is based on probabilistic cross-species mapping of functionally analogous proteins based on Bayesian integrative analysis of gene expression compendia. We demonstrate that even among closely related genes, our method is able to predict functionally analogous homolog pairs better than relying on sequence comparison alone. We also demonstrate that the landscape of functional similarity is often complex and that definitive "functional orthologs" do not always exist. Even in these cases, our method and the online interface we provide are designed to allow detailed exploration of sources of inferred functional similarity that can be evaluated by the user.},

This review summarizes the current understanding of their mechanism of action, their state of clinical development, and possible mechanisms of resistance. {RECENT} {FINDINGS} Poly {ADP}-ribose polymerase inhibitors were predicted to cause lethality in cells with lesions in homologous recombination, as well as to be synergistic with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Recent clinical trial results have validated both of these hypotheses. In addition, studies have begun to examine possible mechanisms of resistance. {SUMMARY} Poly {ADP}-ribose polymerase inhibitors were developed with the idea of synthetic lethality in mind, a concept from classical genetics that may be a general approach to finding new targets for cancer therapy. They show activity as monotherapy in cancers with defective homologous recombination, and they may potentiate the action of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.},

When processing microarray data sets, we recently noticed that some gene names were being changed inadvertently to non-gene names.


{RESULTS}

A little detective work traced the problem to default date format conversions and floating-point format conversions in the very useful Excel program package. The date conversions affect at least 30 gene names; the floating-point conversions affect at least 2,000 if Riken identifiers are included. These conversions are irreversible; the original gene names cannot be recovered.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Users of Excel for analyses involving gene names should be aware of this problem, which can cause genes, including medically important ones, to be lost from view and which has contaminated even carefully curated public databases. We provide work-arounds and scripts for circumventing the problem.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The analysis of high-throughput gene expression data with respect to sets of genes rather than individual genes has many advantages. A variety of methods have been developed for assessing the enrichment of sets of genes with respect to differential expression. In this paper we provide a comparative study of four of these methods: Fisher's exact test, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA}), Random-Sets ({RS}), and Gene List Analysis with Prediction Accuracy ({GLAPA}). The first three methods use associative statistics, while the fourth uses predictive statistics. We first compare all four methods on simulated data sets to verify that Fisher's exact test is markedly worse than the other three approaches. We then validate the other three methods on seven real data sets with known genetic perturbations and then compare the methods on two cancer data sets where our a priori knowledge is limited.


{RESULTS}

The simulation study highlights that none of the three method outperforms all others consistently. {GSEA} and {RS} are able to detect weak signals of deregulation and they perform differently when genes in a gene set are both differentially up and down regulated. {GLAPA} is more conservative and large differences between the two phenotypes are required to allow the method to detect differential deregulation in gene sets. This is due to the fact that the enrichment statistic in {GLAPA} is prediction error which is a stronger criteria than classical two sample statistic as used in {RS} and {GSEA}. This was reflected in the analysis on real data sets as {GSEA} and {RS} were seen to be significant for particular gene sets while {GLAPA} was not, suggesting a small effect size. We find that the rank of gene set enrichment induced by {GLAPA} is more similar to {RS} than {GSEA}. More importantly, the rankings of the three methods share significant overlap.


{CONCLUSION}

The three methods considered in our study recover relevant gene sets known to be deregulated in the experimental conditions and pathologies analyzed. There are differences between the three methods and {GSEA} seems to be more consistent in finding enriched gene sets, although no method uniformly dominates over all data sets. Our analysis highlights the deep difference existing between associative and predictive methods for detecting enrichment and the use of both to better interpret results of pathway analysis. We close with suggestions for users of gene set methods.},

Herein, we test the hypothesis that endogenous anorectic peptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript ({CART}) may be involved in these nicotine triggered physiological disturbances. In acute study, an anorectic effect of intraperitoneal nicotine was significantly potentiated by intracerebroventricular pre-treatment with {CART} at 2 and 4 h post-injection time-points. In chronic study, following an initial reduction, food intake, but not body weight, was progressively restored to normal. On the other hand, termination of chronic nicotine treatment resulted in significant hyperphagia and weight gain. These effects of nicotine were abolished if the rats were concomitantly treated with {CART}. An immunohistochemical profile of hypothalamic {CART} was studied following different nicotine treatment conditions. Acute nicotine treatment caused a significant increase above control in the {CART}-immunoreactive cells and fibers in the hypothalamic paraventricular ({PVN}) and fibers in the arcuate ({ARC}) nuclei. However, chronic nicotine administration had no effect on the {CART}-immunoreactivity in the {PVN} and {ARC}. While nicotine withdrawal reduced the population of {CART}-immunoreactive cells and fibers in the {PVN}, the immunoreactivity in the {ARC} fibers was increased. The results suggest that hypothalamic {CART} may process the acute, chronic and withdrawal effects of nicotine on feeding and body weight.},

Mucinous carcinoma of the breast is also a rare distinct entity and is classified into types A (paucicellular) and B (hypercellular). It is well known that type B mucinous carcinoma frequently shows neuroendocrine differentiation. However, the coexistence of {NEC} and mucinous carcinoma within the same breast tumor is extremely rare. In the present study, we report a case of solid {NEC} of the breast with a mucinous carcinoma component and discuss the tumorigenesis of this extremely rare lesion. A 37-year-old Japanese female presented with a right breast tumor. Mastectomy and removal of the right axillary lymph nodes were performed. The resected breast tumor was composed of solid {NEC} (approximately 85\% of the tumor) and type B mucinous carcinoma components. The right axillary lymph nodes had metastatic solid {NEC}. Three years later, local recurrence of mucinous carcinoma occurred in the operation scar of the right thoracic wall. In addition, seven years after the first surgery, metastatic solid {NEC} in the liver was observed. Recent molecular studies clearly revealed that no differences in gene expression are present between type B mucinous carcinoma and {NEC}. Therefore, the present case may represent solid {NEC} and type B mucinous carcinoma as part of a spectrum with the same genetic background. Moreover, the prognosis of solid {NEC} is thought to be good, and metastasis is extremely rare. However, metastasis of solid {NEC} of the breast may occur at a later stage. Therefore, long-term follow-up is required for patients with solid {NEC} of the breast.},

{METHODS}: Gene expression patterns in breast biopsies from 79 healthy women referred to breast diagnostic centers in Norway were explored by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and supervised analyses, such as gene set enrichment analysis and gene ontology analysis and comparison with previously published genelists and independent datasets.
{RESULTS}: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified two separate clusters of normal breast tissue based on gene-expression profiling, regardless of clustering algorithm and gene filtering used. Comparison of the expression profile of the two clusters with several published gene lists describing breast cells revealed that the samples in cluster 1 share characteristics with stromal cells and stem cells, and to a certain degree with mesenchymal cells and myoepithelial cells. The samples in cluster 1 also share many features with the newly identified claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtype, which also shows characteristics of stromal and stem cells. More women belonging to cluster 1 have a family history of breast cancer and there is a slight overrepresentation of nulliparous women in cluster 1. Similar findings were seen in a separate dataset consisting of histologically normal tissue from both breasts harboring breast cancer and from mammoplasty reductions.
{CONCLUSION}: This is the first study to explore the variability of gene expression patterns in whole biopsies from normal breasts and identified distinct subtypes of normal breast tissue. Further studies are needed to determine the specific cell contribution to the variation in the biology of normal breasts, how the clusters identified relate to breast cancer risk and their possible link to the origin of the different molecular subtypes of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{GIPC}1 is a cytoplasmic scaffold protein that interacts with numerous receptor signaling complexes, and emerging evidence suggests that it plays a role in tumorigenesis. {GIPC}1 is highly expressed in a number of human malignancies, including breast, ovarian, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. Suppression of {GIPC}1 in human pancreatic cancer cells inhibits in vivo tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. To better understand {GIPC}1 function, we suppressed its expression in human breast and colorectal cancer cell lines and human mammary epithelial cells ({HMECs}) and assayed both gene expression and cellular phenotype. Suppression of {GIPC}1 promotes apoptosis in {MCF}-7, {MDA}-{MD}231, {SKBR}-3, {SW}480, and {SW}620 cells and impairs anchorage-independent colony formation of {HMECs}. These observations indicate {GIPC}1 plays an essential role in oncogenic transformation, and its expression is necessary for the survival of human breast and colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, a {GIPC}1 knock-down gene signature was used to interrogate publically available breast and ovarian cancer microarray datasets. This {GIPC}1 signature statistically correlates with a number of breast and ovarian cancer phenotypes and clinical outcomes, including patient survival. Taken together, these data indicate that {GIPC}1 inhibition may represent a new target for therapeutic development for the treatment of human cancers.},

	shorttitle = {Pathogenesis of ovarian cancer},
	abstract = {The accepted view of ovarian carcinogenesis is that carcinoma begins in the ovary, undergoes progressive "dedifferentiation" from a well to a poorly differentiated tumor, and then spreads to the pelvic and abdominal cavities before metastasizing to distant sites. It has therefore been reasoned that survival for this highly lethal disease could be improved by developing screening methods that detect disease when it is confined to the ovary. To date, however, no prospective randomized trial of any ovarian cancer screening test(s) has demonstrated a decrease in mortality. We believe that one of the main reasons for this is that the dogma underlying ovarian carcinogenesis is flawed. Based on studies performed in our laboratory during the last decade, we have proposed a model of ovarian carcinogenesis that takes into account the diverse nature of ovarian cancer and correlates the clinical, pathological, and molecular features of the disease. In this model, ovarian tumors are divided into 2 groups designated type I and type {II}. Type I tumors are slow growing, generally confined to the ovary at diagnosis, and develop from well-established precursor lesions that are termed "borderline" tumors. Type I tumors include low-grade micropapillary serous carcinoma, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell carcinomas. They are genetically stable and are characterized by mutations in a number of different genes including {KRAS}, {BRAF}, {PTEN}, and beta-catenin. Type {II} tumors are rapidly growing highly aggressive neoplasms for which well-defined precursor lesions have not been described. Type {II} tumors include high-grade serous carcinoma, malignant mixed mesodermal tumors (carcinosarcomas), and undifferentiated carcinomas. This group of tumors has a high level of genetic instability and is characterized by mutation of {TP}53. The model helps to explain why current screening techniques, aimed at detecting stage I disease, have not been effective. Tumors that remain confined to the ovary for a long period belong to the type I group, but they account for only 25\% of the malignant tumors. Most of what is considered ovarian cancer belongs to the type {II} category, and these are only rarely confined to the ovary. Although the reasons for this are not entirely clear, possible explanations include rapid spread from the ovary early in carcinogenesis and development of carcinoma in extra ovarian sites, notably, the peritoneum and fallopian tube, with secondary involvement of the ovary. The latter tumors are advanced stage at their inception. Therefore, a more realistic end point for the early detection of ovarian cancer is volume and not stage of disease. The model does not replace the histopathologic classification but, by drawing attention to the molecular genetic events that play a role in tumor progression, sheds light on new approaches to early detection and treatment.},

Although certain studies have examined their pathological and molecular profile, the vascular characteristics of lymphatic and blood vessels have not been examined. Immunohistochemical staining with podoplanin, {CD}34 and {CD}31 was used to examine lymphatic and microvessel density, as well as vascular invasion in 197 basal-like and in 99 triple-negative breast tumours and compared against 200 non-basal and 334 non-triple-negative cases. All specimens were lymph node negative. Vascular invasion was identified as blood or lymphatic vascular invasion by the differential expression of markers. All measurements were correlated with clinicopathological features and prognosis. No significant difference was detected between the basal and triple-negative groups in terms of lymphatic or microvessel density or vascular invasion. However, both the basal and the triple-negative groups showed significantly higher microvessel density than did the non-basal and non-triple-negative groups (P=0.017 and P{\textless}0.001, respectively). Unlike microvessel density, no significant difference was detected in lymphatic density between the basal or triple-negative groups compared with their respective controls. Interestingly, vascular invasion, almost entirely lymphatic invasion, was detected in 27\% of the basal and in 26\% of the triple-negative groups with no significant difference in comparison with control groups. In both basal and triple negatives, vascular invasion was associated with poorer survival by univariate and multivariate analyses. The 20-year overall survival rate in basal-like tumours was 55\% in vascular invasion-positive cases compared with 73\% in vascular invasion-negative tumours (P=0.012), and 46\% in triple-negative vascular invasion-positive compared with 79\% in vascular invasion-negative tumours (P=0.001). Basal-like vs non-basal-like and triple-negative vs non-triple-negative tumours have similar vascular characteristics in terms of lymphatic vessel density and vascular invasion but higher microvessel density, suggesting that such groups may preferentially benefit from anti-angiogenic therapy. Vascular invasion was, in all phenotypes, almost entirely lymphatic vessel invasion and could stratify basal-like and triple-negative phenotypes into distinct prognostic groups.},

	volume = {10},

	abstract = {Background Data integration is currently one of the main challenges in the biomedical sciences. Often different pieces of information are gathered on the same set of entities (e.g., tissues, culture samples, biomolecules) with the different pieces stemming, for example, from different measurement techniques. This implies that more and more data appear that consist of two or more data arrays that have a shared mode. An integrative analysis of such coupled data should be based on a simultaneous analysis of all data arrays. In this respect, the family of simultaneous component methods (e.g., {SUM}-{PCA}, unrestricted {PCovR}, {MFA}, {STATIS}, and {SCA}-P) is a natural choice. Yet, different simultaneous component methods may lead to quite different results. Results We offer a structured overview of simultaneous component methods that frames them in a principal components setting such that both the common core of the methods and the specific elements with regard to which they differ are highlighted. An overview of principles is given that may guide the data analyst in choosing an appropriate simultaneous component method. Several theoretical and practical issues are illustrated with an empirical example on metabolomics data for Escherichia coli as obtained with different analytical chemical measurement methods. Conclusion Of the aspects in which the simultaneous component methods differ, pre-processing and weighting are consequential. Especially, the type of weighting of the different matrices is essential for simultaneous component analysis. These types are shown to be linked to different specifications of the idea of a fair integration of the different coupled arrays.},

The principles defining the relationships between these elements and distal target genes remain unknown. Promoters and distal elements can engage in looping interactions that have been implicated in gene regulation. Here we have applied chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) to interrogate comprehensively interactions between transcription start sites ({TSSs}) and distal elements in 1\% of the human genome representing the {ENCODE} pilot project regions. 5C maps were generated for {GM}12878, K562 and {HeLa}-S3 cells and results were integrated with data from the {ENCODE} consortium. In each cell line we discovered {\textgreater}1,000 long-range interactions between promoters and distal sites that include elements resembling enhancers, promoters and {CTCF}-bound sites. We observed significant correlations between gene expression, promoter-enhancer interactions and the presence of enhancer {RNAs}. Long-range interactions show marked asymmetry with a bias for interactions with elements located ∼120 kilobases upstream of the {TSS}. Long-range interactions are often not blocked by sites bound by {CTCF} and cohesin, indicating that many of these sites do not demarcate physically insulated gene domains. Furthermore, only ∼7\% of looping interactions are with the nearest gene, indicating that genomic proximity is not a simple predictor for long-range interactions. Finally, promoters and distal elements are engaged in multiple long-range interactions to form complex networks. Our results start to place genes and regulatory elements in three-dimensional context, revealing their functional relationships.},

	abstract = {Biomolecular pathways are built from diverse types of pairwise interactions, ranging from physical protein-protein interactions and modifications to indirect regulatory relationships. One goal of systems biology is to bridge three aspects of this complexity: the growing body of high-throughput data assaying these interactions; the specific interactions in which individual genes participate; and the genome-wide patterns of interactions in a system of interest. Here, we describe methodology for simultaneously predicting specific types of biomolecular interactions using high-throughput genomic data. This results in a comprehensive compendium of whole-genome networks for yeast, derived from ∼3,500 experimental conditions and describing 30 interaction types, which range from general (e.g. physical or regulatory) to specific (e.g. phosphorylation or transcriptional regulation). We used these networks to investigate molecular pathways in carbon metabolism and cellular transport, proposing a novel connection between glycogen breakdown and glucose utilization supported by recent publications. Additionally, 14 specific predicted interactions in {DNA} topological change and protein biosynthesis were experimentally validated. We analyzed the systems-level network features within all interactomes, verifying the presence of small-world properties and enrichment for recurring network motifs.

	abstract = {{HIV}-1 drug resistance is a major clinical problem. Resistance is evaluated using in vitro assays measuring the fold change in {IC}(50) caused by resistance mutations. Antiretroviral drugs are used at concentrations above {IC}(50), however, and inhibition at clinical concentrations can only be predicted from {IC}(50) if the shape of the dose-response curve is also known. Curve shape is influenced by cooperative interactions and is described mathematically by the slope parameter or Hill coefficient (m). Implicit in current analysis of resistance is the assumption that mutations shift dose-response curves to the right without affecting the slope. We show here that m is altered by resistance mutations. For reverse transcriptase and fusion inhibitors, single resistance mutations affect both slope and {IC}(50). For protease inhibitors, single mutations primarily affect slope. For integrase inhibitors, only {IC}(50) is affected. Thus, there are fundamental pharmacodynamic differences in resistance to different drug classes. Instantaneous inhibitory potential ({IIP}), the log inhibition of single-round infectivity at clinical concentrations, takes into account both slope and {IC}(50), and thus provides a direct measure of the reduction in susceptibility produced by mutations and the residual activity of drugs against resistant viruses. The standard measure, fold change in {IC}(50), does not correlate well with changes in {IIP} when mutations alter slope. These results challenge a fundamental assumption underlying current analysis of {HIV}-1 drug resistance and suggest that a more complete understanding of how resistance mutations reduce antiviral activity requires consideration of a previously ignored parameter, the dose-response curve slope.},

	abstract = {Although many breast cancers respond to chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, lack of tumor eradication is a central clinical problem preceding the development of drug resistant tumors. Using the K14cre;Brca1(F5-13/F5-13);p53(F2-10/F2-10) mouse model for hereditary breast cancer, we have previously studied responses of mammary tumors to clinically relevant anti-cancer drugs, including cisplatin. The {BRCA}1- and p53-deficient tumors generated in this model are hypersensitive to cisplatin and never become resistant to this agent due to the large, irreversible deletion in Brca1. We show here that even dose-dense treatment with a maximum tolerated dose of cisplatin does not result in complete tumor eradication. To explain this result we have addressed the hypothesis that the lack of eradication of drug-sensitive tumors is due to increased in vivo chemotherapy resistance of tumor-initiating cells ({TICs}). Using the {CD}24 and {CD}49f cell surface markers which detect normal mouse mammary stem cells, we have identified tumor-initiating cells in {BRCA}1- and p53-deficient tumors. In addition to the Lin⁻/{CD}24(+)/{CD}49f(+) subpopulation, we show that a larger population of Lin⁻/{CD}24(+)/{CD}49f-cells also has tumor-initiating capability in at least two serial orthotopic transplantations, suggesting that these are not more differentiated transit-amplifying cells. However, we did not find an enrichment of {TICs} in cisplatin-treated tumor remnants. We conclude that in this model the tolerance of the cisplatin-surviving cells cannot be attributed to special biochemical defense mechanisms of {TICs}.},

Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The cross talk between the stroma and cancer cells plays a major role in phenotypic modulation. During peritoneal carcinomatosis ovarian cancer cells interact with mesenchymal stem cells ({MSC}) resulting in increased metastatic ability. Understanding the transcriptomic changes underlying the phenotypic modulation will allow identification of key genes to target. However in the context of personalized medicine we must consider inter and intra tumoral heterogeneity. In this study we used a pathway-based approach to illustrate the role of cell line background in transcriptomic modification during a cross talk with {MSC}.
{METHODS}: We used two ovarian cancer cell lines as a surrogate for different ovarian cancer subtypes: {OVCAR}3 for an epithelial and {SKOV}3 for a mesenchymal subtype. We co-cultured them with {MSCs}. Genome wide gene expression was determined after cell sorting. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to decipher the cell specific transcriptomic changes related to different pro-metastatic traits (Adherence, migration, invasion, proliferation and chemoresistance).
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate that co-culture of ovarian cancer cells in direct cellular contact with {MSCs} induces broad transcriptomic changes related to enhance metastatic ability. Genes related to cellular adhesion, invasion, migration, proliferation and chemoresistance were enriched under these experimental conditions. Network analysis of differentially expressed genes clearly shows a cell type specific pattern.
{CONCLUSION}: The contact with the mesenchymal niche increase metastatic initiation and expansion through cancer cells' transcriptome modification dependent of the cellular subtype. Personalized medicine strategy might benefit from network analysis revealing the subtype specific nodes to target to disrupt acquired pro-metastatic profile.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Predictors for site of distant metastasis and impact on survival in breast cancer are incompletely understood.
{METHODS}: Clinico-pathological risk factors for site of distant metastasis and survival were analysed in patients with invasive breast cancer treated between 1986 and 2006.
{RESULTS}: Of 3553 patients, with median follow-up 6.32years, 825 (23\%) developed distant metastasis. The site of metastasis was bone in 196/825 (24\%), viscera in 540/825 (65\%) and unknown in 89 (11\%). Larger primary invasive tumour size, higher tumour grade and axillary nodal positivity increased risk of metastasis to all sites. Lobular carcinoma was more likely to first metastasise to bone compared to invasive ductal carcinoma ({NST}). Oestrogen receptor ({ER}) negative, progesterone receptor ({PgR}) negative and/or Human epidermal growth factor ({HER}2) positive tumours were more likely to metastasise to viscera. A striking relationship between increasing age at diagnosis and a reduction in risk of distant metastasis to bone and viscera was observed. Median time to death from onset of metastatic disease was 1.52 (Interquartile range ({IQR}) 0.7-2.9)years for patients with bone metastasis and 0.7 ({IQR} 0.2-1.5)years for visceral metastasis. On multivariate analysis, despite the decrease in risk of distant metastasis with increasing age, there was an elevated hazard for death in patients {\textgreater}50years at diagnosis of metastasis if they developed bone metastasis, with a similar trend observed in the {\textgreater}70years age group if they developed visceral metastasis.
{CONCLUSION}: These findings indicate that there are biological mechanisms underlying the impact of age on the development of distant metastasis and subsequent death. This may have important implications in the treatment of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}

We have previously reported that tumour-specific expression of the rate-limiting enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-coenzyme A reductase ({HMG}-{CoAR}), in the mevalonate pathway is associated with more favourable tumour parameters in breast cancer. In the present study, we examined the prognostic value of {HMG}-{CoAR} expression in a large cohort of primary breast cancer patients with long-term follow up.


{METHODS}

The expression of {HMG}-{CoAR} was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays with tumour specimens from 498 consecutive cases of breast cancer with a median follow-up of 128 months. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to estimate the rate of recurrence-free survival ({RFS}) and breast cancer specific survival ({BCSS}).


{RESULTS}

In line with our previous findings, tumour-specific {HMG}-{CoAR} expression was associated with low grade (p {\textless} 0.001), small size (p = 0.007), oestrogen receptor ({ER}) positive (p = 0.01), low Ki-67 (p = 0.02) tumours. Patients with tumours expressing {HMG}-{CoAR} had a significantly prolonged {RFS}, even when adjusted for established prognostic factors (relative risk [{RR}] = 0.60, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.40 to 0.92; p = 0.02). In {ER}-negative tumours, however, there was a trend, that was not significantly significant, towards a shorter {RFS} in {HMG}-{CoAR} expressing tumours.


{CONCLUSIONS}

{HMG}-{CoAR} expression is an independent predictor of a prolonged {RFS} in primary breast cancer. This may, however, not be true for {ER}-negative tumours. Further studies are needed to shed light on the value of {HMG}-{CoAR} expression as a surrogate marker of response to statin treatment, especially with respect to hormone receptor status.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The diverse microarray datasets that have become available over the past several years represent a rich opportunity and challenge for biological data mining. Many supervised and unsupervised methods have been developed for the analysis of individual microarray datasets. However, integrated analysis of multiple datasets can provide a broader insight into genetic regulation of specific biological pathways under a variety of conditions. {RESULTS}: To aid in the analysis of such large compendia of microarray experiments, we present Microarray Experiment Functional Integration Technology ({MEFIT}), a scalable Bayesian framework for predicting functional relationships from integrated microarray datasets. Furthermore, {MEFIT} predicts these functional relationships within the context of specific biological processes. All results are provided in the context of one or more specific biological functions, which can be provided by a biologist or drawn automatically from catalogs such as the Gene Ontology ({GO}). Using {MEFIT}, we integrated 40 Saccharomyces cerevisiae microarray datasets spanning 712 unique conditions. In tests based on 110 biological functions drawn from the {GO} biological process ontology, {MEFIT} provided a 5\% or greater performance increase for 54 functions, with a 5\% or more decrease in performance in only two functions.},

A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. {RESULTS} A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received {CHOP} and patients who received R-{CHOP}. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. {CONCLUSIONS} Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

	doi = {10.1186/1476-4598-10-117},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Tumor-associated macrophages ({TAMs}) are alternatively activated cells induced by interleukin-4 ({IL}-4)-releasing {CD}4+ T cells. {TAMs} promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis; however, the mechanisms underlying these interactions between macrophages and tumor cells that lead to cancer metastasis remain elusive. Previous studies have found {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) circulating in the peripheral blood and have identified microvesicles, or exosomes, as mediators of cell-cell communication. Therefore, one alternative mechanism for the promotion of breast cancer cell invasion by {TAMs} may be through macrophage-secreted exosomes, which would deliver invasion-potentiating {miRNAs} to breast cancer cells.
{RESULTS}: We utilized a co-culture system with {IL}-4-activated macrophages and breast cancer cells to verify that {miRNAs} are transported from macrophages to breast cancer cells. The shuttling of fluorescently-labeled exogenous {miRNAs} from {IL}-4-activated macrophages to co-cultivated breast cancer cells without direct cell-cell contact was observed. {miR}-223, a {miRNA} specific for {IL}-4-activated macrophages, was detected within the exosomes released by macrophages and was significantly elevated in the co-cultivated {SKBR}3 and {MDA}-{MB}-231 cells. The invasiveness of the co-cultivated breast cancer cells decreased when the {IL}-4-activated macrophages were treated with a {miR}-223 antisense oligonucleotide ({ASO}) that would inhibit {miR}-223 expression. Furthermore, results from a functional assay revealed that {miR}-223 promoted the invasion of breast cancer cells via the Mef2c-β-catenin pathway.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We conclude that macrophages regulate the invasiveness of breast cancer cells through exosome-mediated delivery of oncogenic {miRNAs}. Our data provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the metastasis-promoting interactions between macrophages and breast cancer cells.},

A selected number of practically useful systems are introduced together with the type of user queries supported and the results they generate. The extraction of biological relationships, such as protein-protein interactions as well as metabolic and signaling pathways using information extraction systems, will be discussed through example cases of cancer-relevant proteins. Basic strategies for detecting associations of genes to diseases together with literature mining of mutations, {SNPs}, and epigenetic information (methylation) are described. We provide an overview of disease-centric and gene-centric literature mining methods for linking genes to phenotypic and genotypic aspects. Moreover, we discuss recent efforts for finding biomarkers through text mining and for gene list analysis and prioritization. Some relevant issues for implementing a customized biomedical text mining system will be pointed out. To demonstrate the usefulness of literature mining for the molecular oncology domain, we implemented two cancer-related applications. The first tool consists of a literature mining system for retrieving human mutations together with supporting articles. Specific gene mutations are linked to a set of predefined cancer types. The second application consists of a text categorization system supporting breast cancer-specific literature search and document-based breast cancer gene ranking. Future trends in text mining emphasize the importance of community efforts such as the {BioCreative} challenge for the development and integration of multiple systems into a common platform provided by the {BioCreative} Metaserver.},

	abstract = {Bone is a preferred site for breast cancer metastasis and leads to pathological bone loss due to increased osteoclast-induced bone resorption. The homing of tumor cells to the bone depends on the support of the bone microenvironment in which the tumor cells prime the pre-metastatic niche. The colonization and growth of tumor cells then depends on adaptations in the invading tumor cells to take advantage of normal physiological responses by mimicking bone marrow cells. This concerted effort by tumor cells leads to uncoupled bone remodeling in which the balance of osteoclast-driven bone resorption and osteoblast-driven bone deposition is lost. Breast cancer bone metastases often lead to osteolytic lesions due to hyperactive bone resorption. Release of growth factors from bone matrix during resorption then feeds a 'vicious cycle' of bone destruction leading to many skeletal related events. In addition to activity in bone, some of the factors released during bone resorption are also known to be involved in skeletal muscle regeneration and contraction. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that lead to osteolytic breast cancer bone metastases and the potential for cancer-induced bone-muscle cross-talk leading to skeletal muscle weakness.},

Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis ({SGCCA}) is proposed to combine {RGCCA} with an [Formula: see text]-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes {SGCCA} a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems.

In contrast, p63 and p73 are not lost in cancer but mediate distinct genetic roles in normal and tumor-specific contexts: p73 promotes genome stability and mediates chemosensitivity, while p63 largely lacks these p53-like functions and instead promotes proliferation and cell survival. We recently uncovered a mechanism which maintains p63/p73 homeostasis within the epithelium through direct transcriptional regulation of {microRNAs} ({miRs}). We discovered that several of the top p63-regulated {miRs} target p73 for inhibition, including {miR}-193a-5p, a direct p63/p73 transcriptional target which is repressed by p63 and activated by p73 both in vitro and in vivo. The resulting feed-forward circuit involving p63, {miR}-193a-5p and p73 controls p73 levels, cell viability and {DNA} damage susceptibility in certain cancers including squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we discuss the evolutionary implications of this regulatory circuit, which may point to a general mechanism of {miR}-mediated cross-talk within transcription factor gene families. Additionally, we suggest that inducible chemoresistance mediated by this {miR}-dependent mechanism might be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.},

Reformulating this multilinear {HOSVD} such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this {HOSVD} with an integration of genome-scale {mRNA} expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression. A genome-scale correlation between {DNA} replication initiation and {RNA} transcription, which is equivalent to a recently discovered correlation and might be due to a previously unknown mechanism of regulation, is independently uncovered.},

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

	abstract = {Historical data have indicated the potential for the histologically-normal breast to harbor pre-malignant changes at the molecular level. We postulated that a histologically-normal tissue with "tumor-like" gene expression pattern might harbor substantial risk for future cancer development. Genes associated with these high-risk tissues were considered to be "malignancy-risk genes". From a total of 90 breast cancer patients, we collected a set of 143 histologically-normal breast tissues derived from patients harboring breast cancer who underwent curative mastectomy, as well as a set of 42 invasive ductal carcinomas ({IDC}) of various histologic grades. All samples were assessed for global gene expression differences using microarray analysis. For the purpose of this study we defined normal breast tissue to include histologically normal and benign lesions. Here we report the discovery of a "malignancy-risk" gene signature that may portend risk of breast cancer development in benign, but molecularly-abnormal, breast tissue. Pathway analysis showed that the malignancy-risk signature had a dramatic enrichment for genes with proliferative function, but appears to be independent of {ER}, {PR}, and {HER}2 status. The signature was validated by {RT}-{PCR}, with a high correlation (Pearson correlation = 0.95 with P {\textless} 0.0001) with microarray data. These results suggest a predictive role for the malignancy-risk signature in normal breast tissue. Proliferative biology dominates the earliest stages of tumor development.},

	abstract = {The development of human cancers is a multistep process in which normal cells acquire characteristics that ultimately lead to their conversion into cancer cells. Many obstacles must be overcome for this process to occur; of these obstacles, is the ability to survive an inhospitable microenvironment. It is recognized that the intercommunication between tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment is essential to overcoming this obstacle and for the tumor to progress, metastasize and establish itself at distant sites. Exosomes are membrane-derived vesicles that have recently been recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication, as they carry lipids, proteins, {mRNAs} and {microRNAs} that can be transferred to a recipient cell via fusion of the exosome with the target cell membrane. In the context of cancer cells, this process entails the transfer of cancer-promoting cellular contents to surrounding cells within the tumor microenvironment or into the circulation to act at distant sites, thereby enabling cancer progression. In this process, the transfer of exosomal {microRNAs} to a recipient cell where they can regulate target gene expression is of particular interest, both in understanding the basic biology of cancer progression and for the development of therapeutic approaches. This review discusses the exosome-mediated intercellular communication via {microRNAs} within the tumor microenvironment in human cancers, with a particular focus on breast cancer exosomes.},

Such data provide unique opportunities to study the coordination between regulatory mechanisms on multiple levels. However, integrative analysis of multi-dimensional genomics data for the discovery of combinatorial patterns is currently lacking. Here, we adopt a joint matrix factorization technique to address this challenge. This method projects multiple types of genomic data onto a common coordinate system, in which heterogeneous variables weighted highly in the same projected direction form a multi-dimensional module (md-module). Genomic variables in such modules are characterized by significant correlations and likely functional associations. We applied this method to the {DM}, {GE}, and {microRNA} expression data of 385 ovarian cancer samples from the The Cancer Genome Atlas project. These md-modules revealed perturbed pathways that would have been overlooked with only a single type of data, uncovered associations between different layers of cellular activities and allowed the identification of clinically distinct patient subgroups. Our study provides an useful protocol for uncovering hidden patterns and their biological implications in multi-dimensional ‘omic’ data.},

	abstract = {Human genomic data of many types are readily available, but the complexity and scale of human molecular biology make it difficult to integrate this body of data, understand it from a systems level, and apply it to the study of specific pathways or genetic disorders. An investigator could best explore a particular protein, pathway, or disease if given a functional map summarizing the data and interactions most relevant to his or her area of interest. Using a regularized Bayesian integration system, we provide maps of functional activity and interaction networks in over 200 areas of human cellular biology, each including information from approximately 30,000 genome-scale experiments pertaining to approximately 25,000 human genes. Key to these analyses is the ability to efficiently summarize this large data collection from a variety of biologically informative perspectives: prediction of protein function and functional modules, cross-talk among biological processes, and association of novel genes and pathways with known genetic disorders. In addition to providing maps of each of these areas, we also identify biological processes active in each data set. Experimental investigation of five specific genes, {AP}3B1, {ATP}6AP1, {BLOC}1S1, {LAMP}2, and {RAB}11A, has confirmed novel roles for these proteins in the proper initiation of macroautophagy in amino acid-starved human fibroblasts.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} The microenvironment plays a major role in the onset and progression of metastasis. Epithelial ovarian cancer ({EOC}) tends to metastasize to the peritoneal cavity where interactions within the microenvironment might lead to chemoresistance. Mesothelial cells are important actors of the peritoneal homeostasis; we determined their role in the acquisition of chemoresistance of ovarian tumours. {METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS} We isolated an original type of stromal cells, referred to as "Hospicells" from ascitis of patients with ovarian carcinosis using limiting dilution. We studied their ability to confer chemoresistance through heterocellular interactions. These stromal cells displayed a new phenotype with positive immunostaining for {CD}9, {CD}10, {CD}29, {CD}146, {CD}166 and Multi drug resistance protein. They preferentially interacted with epithelial ovarian cancer cells. This interaction induced chemoresistance to platin and taxans with the implication of multi-drug resistance proteins. This contact enabled {EOC} cells to capture patches of the Hospicells membrane through oncologic trogocytosis, therefore acquiring their functional P-gp proteins and thus developing chemoresistance. Presence of Hospicells on ovarian cancer tissue micro-array from patients with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was also significantly associated to chemoresistance. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE} This is the first report of trogocytosis occurring between a cancer cell and an original type of stromal cell. This interaction induced autonomous acquisition of chemoresistance. The presence of stromal cells within patient's tumour might be predictive of chemoresistance. The specific interaction between cancer cells and stromal cells might be targeted during chemotherapy.},

Our aim was to analyse these regulatory functions by deriving a comprehensive tissue-specific combined {miRNA} and {mRNA} expression profile of post-natal mouse mammary gland development.We measured the expression of 318 individual murine {miRNAs} by bead-based flow-cytometric profiling of whole mouse mammary glands throughout a 16-point developmental time course, including juvenile, puberty, mature virgin, gestation, lactation, and involution stages. In parallel whole-genome {mRNA} expression data were obtained.One third (n = 102) of all murine {miRNAs} analysed were detected during mammary gland development. {MicroRNAs} were represented in seven temporally co-expressed clusters, which were enriched for both {miRNAs} belonging to the same family and breast cancer-associated {miRNAs}. Global {miRNA} and {mRNA} expression was significantly reduced during lactation and the early stages of involution after weaning. For most detected {miRNA} families we did not observe systematic changes in the expression of predicted targets. For {miRNA} families whose targets did show changes, we observed inverse patterns of {miRNA} and target expression. The data sets are made publicly available and the combined expression profiles represent an important community resource for mammary gland biology research.{MicroRNAs} were expressed in likely co-regulated clusters during mammary gland development. Breast cancer-associated {miRNAs} were significantly enriched in these clusters.

To address this issue, we isolated a rare tumor cell population on the basis of its {CD}44(+){CD}24(-) phenotype from the human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell line {DU}145 and established its {CSC} properties. The behavior of selected {CSC} was investigated with respect to the bulk {DU}145 cells. The injection of {CSC} in nude mice generated highly vascularized tumors infiltrating the adjacent tissues, showing high density of neuroendocrine cells and expressing low levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin as well as high levels of vimentin. On the contrary, when a comparable number of unsorted {DU}145 cells were injected the resulting tumors were less aggressive. To investigate the different features of tumors in vivo, the influence of differentiated tumor cells on {CSC} was examined in vitro by growing {CSC} in the absence or presence of conditioned medium from {DU}145 cells. {CSC} grown in permissive conditions differentiated into cell populations with features similar to those of cells held in aggressive tumors generated from {CSC} injection. Differently, conditioned medium induced {CSC} to differentiate into a cell phenotype comparable to cells of scarcely aggressive tumors originated from bulk {DU}145 cell injection. These findings show for the first time that {CSC} are able to generate differentiated cells expressing either highly or scarcely aggressive phenotype, thus influencing prostate cancer progression. The fate of {CSC} was determined by signals released from tumor environment.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} The study aim to identify novel molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer by gene expression profiling with linkage to clinical and pathologic features. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN} Microarray gene expression profiling was done on 285 serous and endometrioid tumors of the ovary, peritoneum, and fallopian tube. K-means clustering was applied to identify robust molecular subtypes. Statistical analysis identified differentially expressed genes, pathways, and gene ontologies. Laser capture microdissection, pathology review, and immunohistochemistry validated the array-based findings. Patient survival within k-means groups was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Class prediction validated k-means groups in an independent dataset. A semisupervised survival analysis of the array data was used to compare against unsupervised clustering results. {RESULTS} Optimal clustering of array data identified six molecular subtypes. Two subtypes represented predominantly serous low malignant potential and low-grade endometrioid subtypes, respectively. The remaining four subtypes represented higher grade and advanced stage cancers of serous and endometrioid morphology. A novel subtype of high-grade serous cancers reflected a mesenchymal cell type, characterized by overexpression of N-cadherin and P-cadherin and low expression of differentiation markers, including {CA}125 and {MUC}1. A poor prognosis subtype was defined by a reactive stroma gene expression signature, correlating with extensive desmoplasia in such samples. A similar poor prognosis signature could be found using a semisupervised analysis. Each subtype displayed distinct levels and patterns of immune cell infiltration. Class prediction identified similar subtypes in an independent ovarian dataset with similar prognostic trends. {CONCLUSION} Gene expression profiling identified molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer of biological and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Bone metastasis is a complication that occurs in 80 \% of women with advanced breast cancer. Despite the prevalence of bone metastatic disease, the avenues for its clinical management are still restricted to palliative treatment options. In fact, the underlying mechanisms of breast cancer osteotropism have not yet been fully elucidated due to a lack of suitable in vivo models that are able to recapitulate the human disease. In this work, we review the current transplantation-based models to investigate breast cancer-induced bone metastasis and delineate the strengths and limitations of the use of different grafting techniques, tissue sources, and hosts. We further show that humanized xenograft models incorporating human cells or tissue grafts at the primary tumor site or the metastatic site mimic more closely the human disease. Tissue-engineered constructs are emerging as a reproducible alternative to recapitulate functional humanized tissues in these murine models. The development of advanced humanized animal models may provide better platforms to investigate the mutual interactions between human cancer cells and their microenvironment and ultimately improve the translation of preclinical drug trials to the clinic.},

Identification of differentially expressed genes marking {AD} and {SCC} may prove to be of diagnostic value and help unravel molecular basis of their histogenesis and biologies, and deliver more effective and specific systemic therapy. {METHODS}: {MiRNA} target genes were predicted by union of {miRanda}, {TargetScan}, and {PicTar}, followed by screening for matched gene symbols in {NCBI} human sequences and Gene Ontology ({GO}) terms using the {PANTHER} database that was also used for analyzing the significance of biological processes and pathways within each ontology term. Microarray data were extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus repository, and tumor subtype prediction by gene expression used Prediction Analysis of Microarrays. {RESULTS}: Computationally predicted target genes of three {microRNAs}, {miR}-34b/34c/449, that were detected in human lung, testis, and fallopian tubes but not in other normal tissues, were filtered by representation of {GO} terms and their ability to classify lung cancer subtypes, followed by a meta-analysis of microarray data to classify {AD} and {SCC}. Expression of a minimal set of 17 predicted {miR}-34b/34c/449 target genes derived from the developmental process {GO} category was identified from a training set to classify 41 {AD} and 17 {SCC}, and correctly predicted in average 87\% of 354 {AD} and 82\% of 282 {SCC} specimens from total 9 independent published datasets. The accuracy of prediction still remains comparable when classifying 103 {AD} and 79 {SCC} samples from another 4 published datasets that have only 14 to 16 of the 17 genes available for prediction (84\% and 85\% for {AD} and {SCC}, respectively). Expression of this signature in two published datasets of epithelial cells obtained at bronchoscopy from cigarette smokers, if combined with cytopathology of the cells, yielded 89-90\% sensitivity of lung cancer detection and 87-90\% negative predictive value to non-cancer patients. {CONCLUSION}: This study focuses on predicted targets of three lung-enriched {miRNAs}, compares their expression patterns in lung cancer by their {GO} terms, and identifies a minimal set of genes differentially expressed in {AD} and {SCC}, followed by validating this gene signature in multiple published datasets. Expression of this gene signature in bronchial epithelial cells of cigarette smokers also has a great sensitivity to predict the patients having lung cancer if combined with cytopathology of the cells.},

Microarray-based high-throughput technologies have been employed to unravel the molecular characteristics of breast cancer, including its proclivity to disseminate to distant sites, and the molecular basis for histological grade. In addition, a breast cancer molecular taxonomy based solely on transcriptomic analysis has been proposed. Most microarray studies have focused on invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type, neglecting the important information about the biology and clinical behavior of breast cancers conveyed by histological type. Histological special types of breast cancer account for up to 25\% of all invasive breast cancers. The histopathological characteristics of these cancers might be driven by specific genetic alterations, providing direct evidence for genotypic-phenotypic correlations between morphological patterns and molecular changes in breast cancer. We review the historical aspects of breast cancer taxonomy, discuss the possible origins of the diversity of breast cancer and propose an approach for the identification of novel therapeutic targets on the basis of histological special types of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis ({MCIA}), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, {MCIA} simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using {MCIA}, applied to two typical "omics" research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the {NCI}-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation {RNA}-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of {RNA}-sequencing data processed using {RPKM} had greater variance than that with {MapSplice} and {RSEM}. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. {MCIA} is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor "omicade4" package.
{CONCLUSION}: We believe {MCIA} is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. {MCIA} provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

The accuracy of {RNA}-seq can be highly impacted by the purity of samples. A prominent, outstanding problem in {RNA}-seq is how to estimate transcript abundances in heterogeneous tissues, where a sample is composed of more than one cell type and the inhomogeneity can substantially confound the transcript abundance estimation of each individual cell type. Although experimental methods have been proposed to dissect multiple distinct cell types, computationally "deconvoluting" heterogeneous tissues provides an attractive alternative, since it keeps the tissue sample as well as the subsequent molecular content yield intact.

Gene expression studies of in vitro coculture models demonstrate that in vitro models have relevance for tumor progression in vivo. For example, stromal gene expression has been shown to vary in association with tumor subtype in vivo, and analogous in vitro cocultures recapitulate subtype-specific biological interactions. Cocultures can be used to study cancer cell interactions with specific stromal components (e.g., immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelium) and different representative cell lines (e.g., cancer-associated versus normal-associated fibroblasts versus established, immortalized fibroblasts) can help elucidate the role of stromal variation in tumor phenotypes. Gene expression data can also be combined with cell-based assays to identify cellular phenotypes associated with gene expression changes. Coculture systems are manipulable systems that can yield important insights about cell-cell interactions and the cellular phenotypes that occur as tumor and stroma co-evolve.},

{RESULTS}: A total of 12 {miRs} were differentially quantified in prostate cancer patients compared with controls, including 9 in patients without metastases.

It is less common than invasive ductal carcinoma ({IDC}) and few large studies have addressed its biologic characteristics and behaviour with respect to long-term clinical outcome and response to adjuvant therapy. {METHODS}: This study is based on a large and well-characterised consecutive series of invasive breast carcinomas with a long-term follow-up (up to 25 years). This series included 415 (8\%) patients with pure {ILC} and 2901 (55.7\%) with {IDC} (not otherwise specified) identified from a consecutive cohort of 5680 breast tumours presented to our Breast Unit that were treated in a similar conventional manner. Clinicopathological, therapy and outcome information as well as data on a large panel of biomarkers were available. {RESULTS}: Compared to {IDC}, patients with {ILC} tended to be older and present with tumours which are more frequently lower grade (typically, grade 2 [84\%]), hormone-receptor positive (86\% compared to 61\% in {IDC}), of larger size, and with the absence of vascular invasion. A higher frequency of {ILC} was placed in the good Nottingham Prognostic Index group (40\% compared to 21\% in {IDC}). {ILC} showed indolent but progressive behavioural characteristics with nearly linear survival curves which crossed those of {IDC} after approximately 10years of follow-up, thus eventually exhibiting a worse long-term outcome. Importantly, {ILC} showed a better response to adjuvant hormonal therapy ({HT}) with improvement in survival in patients who received {HT} compared with matched patients with {IDC}. {CONCLUSION}: {ILC} is a distinct entity of breast cancer that responds well to adjuvant {HT}. These data add important clinical information for assessing the long-term benefits of adjuvant {HT} use in {ILC}.},

Previously, we developed a mouse model of tumor-bone interaction in which three mouse breast cancer cell lines were implanted onto the calvaria. Analysis of tumors from this model revealed that they exhibited strong bone resorption, induction of osteoclasts and intracranial penetration at the tumor bone ({TB})-interface.
{METHODS}: In this study, we identified and used a {TB} microenvironment-specific gene expression signature from this model to extend our understanding of the metastatic bone microenvironment in human disease and to predict potential therapeutic targets.
{RESULTS}: We identified a {TB} signature consisting of 934 genes that were commonly (among our 3 cell lines) and specifically (as compared to tumor-alone area within the bone microenvironment) up- and down-regulated {\textgreater}2-fold at the {TB} interface in our mouse osteolytic model. By comparing the {TB} signature with gene expression profiles from human breast metastases and an in vitro osteoclast model, we demonstrate that our model mimics both the human breast cancer bone microenvironment and osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we observed enrichment in various signaling pathways specific to the {TB} interface; that is, {TGF}-β and myeloid self-renewal pathways were activated and the Wnt pathway was inactivated. Lastly, we used the {TB}-signature to predict cyclopenthiazide as a potential inhibitor of the {TB} interface.
{CONCLUSION}: Our mouse breast cancer model morphologically and genetically resembles the osteoclastic bone microenvironment observed in human disease. Characterization of the gene expression signature specific to the {TB} interface in our model revealed signaling mechanisms operative in human breast cancer metastases and predicted a therapeutic inhibitor of cancer-mediated osteolysis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The typical objective of Genome-wide association ({GWA}) studies is to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and corresponding genes with the strongest evidence of association (the 'most-significant {SNPs}/genes' approach). Borrowing ideas from micro-array data analysis, we propose a new method, named {RS}-{SNP}, for detecting sets of genes enriched in {SNPs} moderately associated to the phenotype. {RS}-{SNP} assesses whether the number of significant {SNPs}, with p-value P ≤ α, belonging to a given {SNP} set S is statistically significant. The rationale of proposed method is that two kinds of null hypotheses are taken into account simultaneously. In the first null model the genotype and the phenotype are assumed to be independent random variables and the null distribution is the probability of the number of significant {SNPs} in S greater than observed by chance. The second null model assumes the number of significant {SNPs} in S depends on the size of and not on the identity of the {SNPs} in . Statistical significance is assessed using non-parametric permutation tests.


{RESULTS}

We applied {RS}-{SNP} to the Crohn's disease ({CD}) data set collected by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium ({WTCCC}) and compared the results with {GENGEN}, an approach recently proposed in literature. The enrichment analysis using {RS}-{SNP} and the set of pathways contained in the {MSigDB} C2 {CP} pathway collection highlighted 86 pathways rich in {SNPs} weakly associated to {CD}. Of these, 47 were also indicated to be significant by {GENGEN}. Similar results were obtained using the {MSigDB} C5 pathway collection. Many of the pathways found to be enriched by {RS}-{SNP} have a well-known connection to {CD} and often with inflammatory diseases.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The proposed method is a valuable alternative to other techniques for enrichment analysis of {SNP} sets. It is well founded from a theoretical and statistical perspective. Moreover, the experimental comparison with {GENGEN} highlights that it is more robust with respect to false positive findings.},

	abstract = {Although the favourable role of T lymphocyte populations in different tumour types is established, that of B cells is still a matter of debate and needs further clarification. The presence of tumour-infiltrating B cells may represent an antibody response against breast tumour antigens. We used immunohistochemistry to investigate the density and localisation of B lymphocytes infiltrating 1470 breast tumours and to identify any prognostic significance and relationship to various clinicopathological factors. Higher numbers of {CD}20(+) cells were found in the stroma away from the carcinoma (mean 12 cells) compared with either intratumoural or adjacent stromal compartments (mean 1 cell). The majority of tumours showed a diffuse pattern of B cells rather than aggregates. There was a positive correlation between higher numbers of total {CD}20(+) B cells and higher tumour grade (r (s) = 0.20, P {\textless} 0.001), {ER} and {PgR} negativity (P {\textless} 0.001), and basal phenotype (P {\textless} 0.001) subclass. In univariate survival analysis, higher total number of infiltrating {CD}20(+) cells, irrespective of location, was associated with significantly better {BCSS} (P = 0.037) and longer {DFI} (P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, total {CD}20(+) B cell count ({HR} = 0.75, 95\% {CI} = 0.58-0.96 for {BCSS} and {HR} = 0.72, 95\% {CI} = 0.58-0.89, for {DFI}), tumour size, nodal stage, grade, vascular invasion, {HER}-2 status, and total {CD}8(+) T cell count were independently associated with outcome. This suggests that humoral immunity, in addition to the cell mediated immunity, may be important in breast cancer. This should be considered in breast cancer immunotherapy and vaccine strategies.},

Gene expression profiling using {DNA} microarrays has contributed significantly to our understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of breast tumor formation, progression, and recurrence. For example, at least two clinical diagnostic assays exist (i.e., {OncotypeDX} {RS} and Mammaprint®) that are able to predict outcome in patients using patterns of gene expression and predetermined mathematical algorithms. In addition, a new molecular taxonomy based upon the inherent, or "intrinsic," biology of breast tumors has been developed; this taxonomy is called the "intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer," which now identifies five distinct tumor types and a normal breast-like group. Importantly, the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer predict patient relapse, overall survival, and response to endocrine and chemotherapy regimens. Thus, most of the clinical behavior of a breast tumor is already written in its subtype profile. Here, we describe the discovery and basic biology of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, and detail how this interacts with underlying genetic alternations, response to therapy, and the metastatic process.},

	abstract = {The premise that all tumors are targetable has been met with some controversy in the approach to epithelial ovarian cancer ({EOC}). Genomic analysis shows that these tumors (specifically, high-grade serous carcinomas) are genomically unstable and lack actionable driver mutations, much like {HER}2 in breast and gastric cancers. In this paper, Michael Birrer, {MD}, {PhD}, Massachusetts General Hospital, argues that the interpretation of genomic data in ovarian cancer requires a more thoughtful approach that necessitates a closer inspection of the data beyond the mere presence or absence of mutations. We must look at the extensive genomic alterations in {DNA} and, to understand more about the role of those genes affected by these changes, look beyond the tumor to the role of the stroma. As such, Dr. Birrer is arguing for the importance of translational research. This will be the key to precision medicine in ovarian cancer, as we approach drug discovery and improvements in treatment. Dr. Birrer is a world-renowned scientist who has devoted his career to the study of gynecologic cancers. He has published over 200 papers and written over 27 book chapters and reviews, served on numerous leadership positions in gynecologic oncology (including as co-chair of the National Cancer Institute's Gynecologic Cancer Steering Committee), and remains a clinician-scientist with an active lab and an active clinic. His career trajectory has shown me it is possible to be engaged as a researcher and a clinician and the work he has done has already impacted the care of patients with ovarian cancer. Don S.

The authors computed age-adjusted rates, as well as age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted rate ratios ({RR}) for ductal and lobular breast cancer and for the use of estrogen only (E-only) and estrogen and progesterone (E + P) for current and former hormone users by duration of use and years since last use. {RESULTS}: Current use of E + P was associated with an increased risk of both ductal ({RR} of 1.75; 95\% confidence interval [95\% {CI}], 1.53-2.01) and lobular ({RR} of 2.12; 95\% {CI}, 1.62-2.77) breast cancer. Risk increased within the first 2 to 3 years of use and attenuated 2 years after cessation. In contrast, current use of E-only was not associated with an overall increased risk of invasive ductal cancer. The only exceptions to this finding were in lean (body mass index {\textless}25) women and for ductal cancers diagnosed at the regional/distant stage, where in both cases the use of E-only was associated with an increased risk. E-only use was associated with a 50\% increased risk of invasive lobular cancer after {\textgreater}or=10 years of use. {CONCLUSIONS}: Use of E + P is more detrimental to the breast than E-only use, in terms of both ductal and lobular cancer. The findings from the current study suggest a window of 2 to 3 years for the risks of E + P both to become apparent after initial use and to attenuate after cessation.},

Exosomes are enriched with a discrete set of cellular proteins, and therefore expected to exert diverse biological functions according to cell origin. Mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) possess the potential for differentiation into multilineages and can also function as precursors for tumor stroma including myofibroblast that provides a favorable environment for tumor progression. Although a close relationship between tumor cells and {MSCs} in a neoplastic tumor microenvironment has already been revealed, how this communication works is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of tumor cell-derived exosomes on {MSCs} by treating adipose tissue-derived {MSCs} ({ADSCs}) with breast cancer-derived exosomes. The exosome-treated {ADSCs} exhibited the phenotypes of tumor-associated myofibroblasts with increased expression of α-{SMA}. Exosome treatment also induced increased expression of tumor-promoting factors {SDF}-1, {VEGF}, {CCL}5 and {TGFβ}. This phenomenon was correlated with increased expression of {TGFβ} receptor I and {II}. Analysis of {SMAD}2, a key player in the {TGFβ} receptor-mediated {SMAD} pathway, revealed that its phosphorylation was increased by exosome treatment and was inhibited by treatment with {SB}431542, an inhibitor of the {SMAD}-mediated pathway, resulting in decreased expression of α-{SMA}. Taken together, our results show that tumor-derived exosomes induced the myofibroblastic phenotype and functionality in {ADSCs} via the {SMAD}-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that tumor-derived exosomes can contribute to progression and malignancy of tumor cells by converting {MSCs} within tumor stroma into tumor-associated myofibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.},

We also examine the effect of varying the power parameter s on the compromise solutions. All results are illustrated with a number of real data tables.},

	volume = {5},
	abstract = {Maintaining balanced growth in a changing environment is a fundamental systems-level challenge for cellular physiology, particularly in microorganisms. While the complete set of regulatory and functional pathways supporting growth and cellular proliferation are not yet known, portions of them are well understood. In particular, cellular proliferation is governed by mechanisms that are highly conserved from unicellular to multicellular organisms, and the disruption of these processes in metazoans is a major factor in the development of cancer. In this paper, we develop statistical methodology to identify quantitative aspects of the regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular proliferation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that the expression levels of a small set of genes can be exploited to predict the instantaneous growth rate of any cellular culture with high accuracy. The predictions obtained in this fashion are robust to changing biological conditions, experimental methods, and technological platforms. The proposed model is also effective in predicting growth rates for the related yeast Saccharomyces bayanus and the highly diverged yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that the underlying regulatory signature is conserved across a wide range of unicellular evolution. We investigate the biological significance of the gene expression signature that the predictions are based upon from multiple perspectives: by perturbing the regulatory network through the Ras/{PKA} pathway, observing strong upregulation of growth rate even in the absence of appropriate nutrients, and discovering putative transcription factor binding sites, observing enrichment in growth-correlated genes. More broadly, the proposed methodology enables biological insights about growth at an instantaneous time scale, inaccessible by direct experimental methods.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}

Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65\%) and bronchopulmonary tract (25\%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides ({BLP}) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from carcinoids of intestinal origin.


{METHODS}

Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and determine {BLP} levels in these tumors.


{RESULTS}

All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes ({GRPR}, {NMBR}, and {BRS}-3) were present on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low {BLP} levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor ligand binding densities in combination with low {BLP} levels.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar {BLP} levels. The combined presence of bombesin and its receptors might suggest the presence of a paracrine or autocrine growth loop in carcinoids.},

This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the {GWAS} provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary {GWAS} statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations.

Follicular fluid and cells from individual follicles of cattle were grouped based on Brilliant Cresyl Blue ({BCB}) staining of the corresponding oocytes. Both Exoquick precipitation and differential ultracentrifugation were used to separate the exosome and non-exosomal fraction of follicular fluid. Following {miRNA} isolation from both fractions, the human {miRCURY} {LNA}™ Universal {RT} {miRNA} {PCR} array system was used to profile {miRNA} expression. This analysis found that {miRNAs} were present in both exosomal and non-exosomal fraction of bovine follicular fluid.

Expression of selected {miRNAs} was detected in theca, granulosa and cumulus oocyte complex. To further explore the potential roles of these follicular fluid derived extra-cellular {miRNAs}, the potential target genes were predicted, and functional annotation and pathway analysis revealed most of these pathways are known regulators of follicular development and oocyte growth. In order to validate exosome mediated cell-cell communication within follicular microenvironment, we demonstrated uptake of exosomes and resulting increase of endogenous {miRNA} level and subsequent alteration of {mRNA} levels in follicular cells in vitro.

	abstract = {Background/Aim: The phenomenon of membrane vesicle-release by neoplastic cells is a growing field of interest in cancer research, due to their potential role in carrying a large array of tumor antigens when secreted into the extracellular medium. In particular, experimental evidence show that at least some of the tumor markers detected in the blood circulation of mammary carcinoma patients are carried by membrane-bound vesicles. Thus, biomarker research in breast cancer can gain great benefits from vesicle characterization. Materials and Methods: Conditioned medium was collected from serum starved {MDA}-{MB}-231 sub-confluent cell cultures and exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Ultrastructural analysis of {ELVs} was performed by transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) and the purity of fraction was confirmed by western blotting assays. Proteomic profile of {ELVs} was carried out by 2 D-{PAGE} and protein identification performed by {MALDI}-{ToF} Mass Spectrometry. Results: On the basis of ultrastructural and immunological characterization, the isolated vesicles have been classified as exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}). The proteomic investigation showed a distinctive protein profile of the {ELVs}, in comparison to the whole cell lisates ({WCL}) proteome, which could be instrumental for cancer progression. The proteins were clustered into functional categories, according to the current bioinformatics resources and a Venn diagram was constructed based on these clusters. Conclusion: It is reasonable to assume that vesicle production allows neoplastic cells to exert different effects, according to the possible acceptor targets. For instance, vesicles could potentiate the malignant properties of adjacent neoplastic cells or activate non-tumoral cells. Moreover, vesicles could convey signals to immune cells and surrounding stroma cells. The present study may significantly contribute to the knowledge of the vesiculation phenomenon, which is a critical device for trans cellular communication in cancer.},

{ABSTRACT}:


{BACKGROUND}

Numerous transgenic models have been generated to study breast cancer. However, despite many advantages, traditional transgenic models for breast cancer are also burdened with difficulties in early detection and longitudinal observation of transgene-induced tumours, which in most cases are randomly located and occur at various time points. Methods such as palpation followed by mechanical measurement of the tumours are of limited value in transgenic models. There is a crucial need for making these previously generated models suitable for modern methods of tumour visualisation and monitoring, e.g. by bioluminescence-based techniques. This approach was successfully used in the current study.


{RESULTS}

A new mouse strain ({MMTV}-Luc2 mice) expressing Luc2 luciferase primarily in mammary tissue in females, with low-level background expression in internal organs, was generated and bred to homozygosity. After these mice were intercrossed with {MMTV}-{PyVT} mice, all double transgenic females developed mammary tumours by the age of 10 weeks, the localisation and progression of which could be effectively monitored using the luminescence-based in vivo imaging. Luminescence-based readout allowed for early visualisation of the locally overgrown mammary tissue and for longitudinal evaluation of local progression of the tumours. When sampled ex vivo at the age of 10 weeks, all tumours derived from {MMTV}-Luc2PyVT females displayed robust bioluminescent signal.


{CONCLUSIONS}

We have created a novel transgenic strain for visualisation and longitudinal monitoring of mammary tumour development in transgenic mice as an addition and/or a new and more advanced alternative to manual methods. Generation of this mouse strain is vital for making many of the existing mammary tumour transgenic models applicable for in vivo imaging techniques.},

However, extensive genome-wide association studies thus far had limited success because the results have low predictive value of practical utility to individuals. We present a prediction process where two machine-learning analysis methods are applied to two different descriptors of each individual’s common genomic variations to predict an individual’s susceptibility to eight major cancer traits. The accuracy of the prediction ranges from 33\% to 57\% depending on cancer type, which is significantly better than 11\% for a random prediction, with probability estimates that may be useful for making practical health decisions for individuals or for a population., An empirical approach is presented for predicting the genomic susceptibility of an individual to the most likely one among nine traits, consisting of eight major cancer classes plus a healthy trait. We use four prediction methods by applying two supervised learning algorithms to two different descriptors of common genomic variations (the profiles of genotypes of {SNPs} and {SNP} syntaxes with low P values or low frequencies) of each individual genome from normal cells. All four methods made correct predictions substantially better than random predictions for most cancer classes, but not for some others. A combination of the four results using Bayesian inference better predicted overall than any individual method. The multiclass accuracy of the combined prediction ranges from 33\% to 56\% depending on cancer classes of testing sets, compared with 11\% for a random prediction among nine traits. Despite limited {SNP} data available and the absence of rare {SNPs} in public databases, at present, the results suggest that the framework of this approach or its improvement can predict cancer susceptibility with probability estimates useful for making health decisions for individuals or for a population.},

	abstract = {Human breast cancers are broadly classified based on their gene-expression profiles into luminal- and basal-type tumors. These two major tumor subtypes express markers corresponding to the major differentiation states of epithelial cells in the breast: luminal ({EpCAM}+) and basal/myoepithelial ({CD}10+). However, there are also rare types of breast cancers, such as metaplastic carcinomas, where tumor cells exhibit features of alternate cell types that no longer resemble breast epithelium. Until now, it has been difficult to identify the cell type(s) in the human breast that gives rise to these various forms of breast cancer. Here we report that transformation of {EpCAM}+ epithelial cells results in the formation of common forms of human breast cancer, including estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative tumors with luminal and basal-like characteristics, respectively, whereas transformation of {CD}10+ cells results in the development of rare metaplastic tumors reminiscent of the claudin-low subtype. We also demonstrate the existence of {CD}10+ breast cells with metaplastic traits that can give rise to skin and epidermal tissues. Furthermore, we show that the development of metaplastic breast cancer is attributable, in part, to the transformation of these metaplastic breast epithelial cells. These findings identify normal cellular precursors to human breast cancers and reveal the existence of a population of cells with epidermal progenitor activity within adult human breast tissues.},

	abstract = {The incidence of melanoma is increasing rapidly, with advanced lesions generally failing to respond to conventional chemotherapy. Here, we utilized {DNA} microarray-based gene expression profiling techniques to identify molecular determinants of melanoma progression within a unique panel of isogenic human melanoma cell lines. When a poorly tumorigenic cell line, derived from an early melanoma, was compared with two increasingly aggressive derivative cell lines, the expression of 66 genes was significantly changed. A similar pattern of differential gene expression was found with an independently derived metastatic cell line. We further examined these melanoma progression-associated genes via use of a tailored {TaqMan} Low Density Array ({LDA}), representing the majority of genes within our cohort of interest. Considerable concordance was seen between the transcriptomic profiles determined by {DNA} microarray and {TaqMan} {LDA} approaches. A range of novel markers were identified that correlated here with melanoma progression. Most notable was {TSPY}, a Y chromosome-specific gene that displayed extensive down-regulation in expression between the parental and derivative cell lines. Examination of a putative {CpG} island within the {TSPY} gene demonstrated that this region was hypermethylated in the derivative cell lines, as well as metastatic melanomas from male patients. Moreover, treatment of the derivative cell lines with the {DNA} methyltransferase inhibitor, 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine ({DAC}), restored expression of the {TSPY} gene to levels comparable with that found in the parental cells. Additional {DNA} microarray studies uncovered a subset of 13 genes from the above-mentioned 66 gene cohort that displayed re-activation of expression following {DAC} treatment, including {TSPY}, {CYBA} and {MT}2A. {DAC} suppressed tumor cell growth in vitro. Moreover, systemic treatment of mice with {DAC} attenuated growth of melanoma xenografts, with consequent re-expression of {TSPY} {mRNA}. Overall, our data support the hypothesis that multiple genes are targeted, either directly or indirectly, by {DNA} hypermethylation during melanoma progression.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer overall, but few studies have examined the association between mammographic density and specific subtypes of breast cancer, especially aggressive Basal-like breast cancers. Because Basal-like breast cancers are less frequently screen-detected, it is important to understand how mammographic density relates to risk of Basal-like breast cancer.
{METHODS}: We estimated associations between mammographic density and breast cancer risk according to breast cancer subtype. Cases and controls were participants in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study ({CBCS}) who also had mammograms recorded in the Carolina Mammography Registry ({CMR}). A total of 491 cases had mammograms within five years prior to and one year after diagnosis and 528 controls had screening or diagnostic mammograms close to the dates of selection into {CBCS}. Mammographic density was reported to the {CMR} using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categories. The expression of estrogen receptor ({ER}), progesterone receptor ({PR}), human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 and 2 ({HER}1 and {HER}2), and cytokeratin 5/6 ({CK}5/6) were assessed by immunohistochemistry and dichotomized as positive or negative, with {ER}+ and/or {PR}+, and {HER}2- tumors classified as Luminal A and {ER}-, {PR}-, {HER}2-, {HER}1+ and/or {CK}5/6+ tumors classified as Basal-like breast cancer. Triple negative tumors were defined as negative for {ER}, {PR} and {HER}2. Of the 491 cases 175 were missing information on subtypes; the remaining cases included 181 Luminal A, 17 Luminal B, 48 Basal-like, 29 {ER}-/{PR}-/{HER}2+, and 41 unclassified subtypes. Odds ratios comparing each subtype to all controls and case-case odds ratios comparing mammographic density distributions in Basal-like to Luminal A breast cancers were estimated using logistic regression.
{RESULTS}: Mammographic density was associated with increased risk of both Luminal A and Basal-like breast cancers, although estimates were imprecise. The magnitude of the odds ratio associated with mammographic density was not substantially different between Basal-like and Luminal A cancers in case--control analyses and case-case analyses [case-case {OR} = 1.08 (95\% confidence interval: 0.30, 3.84)].
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results suggest that risk estimates associated with mammographic density are not distinct for separate breast cancer subtypes (Basal-like/Triple negative vs. Luminal A breast cancers). Studies with a larger number of Basal-like breast cancers are needed to confirm our findings.},

	abstract = {The skeleton is a preferred homing site for breast cancer metastasis. To date, treatment options for patients with bone metastases are mostly palliative and the disease is still incurable. Indeed, key mechanisms involved in breast cancer osteotropism are still only partially understood due to the lack of suitable animal models to mimic metastasis of human tumor cells to a human bone microenvironment. In the presented study, we investigate the use of a human tissue-engineered bone construct to develop a humanized xenograft model of breast cancer-induced bone metastasis in a murine host. Primary human osteoblastic cell-seeded melt electrospun scaffolds in combination with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 were implanted subcutaneously in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. The tissue-engineered constructs led to the formation of a morphologically intact 'organ' bone incorporating a high amount of mineralized tissue, live osteocytes and bone marrow spaces. The newly formed bone was largely humanized, as indicated by the incorporation of human bone cells and human-derived matrix proteins. After intracardiac injection, the dissemination of luciferase-expressing human breast cancer cell lines to the humanized bone ossicles was detected by bioluminescent imaging. Histological analysis revealed the presence of metastases with clear osteolysis in the newly formed bone. Thus, human tissue-engineered bone constructs can be applied efficiently as a target tissue for human breast cancer cells injected into the blood circulation and replicate the osteolytic phenotype associated with breast cancer-induced bone lesions. In conclusion, we have developed an appropriate model for investigation of species-specific mechanisms of human breast cancer-related bone metastasis in vivo.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Molecular classification of breast cancer is an important prognostic factor. The distribution of molecular subtypes of breast cancer and their prognostic value has not been well documented in Asians.


{METHODS}

A total of 2,791 breast cancer patients recruited for a population-based cohort study were evaluated for molecular subtypes of breast cancer by immunohistochemical assays. Data on clinicopathological characteristics were confirmed by centralized pathology review. The average follow-up of the patients was 53.4 months. Overall and disease-free survival by molecular subtypes of breast cancer were evaluated.


{RESULTS}

The prevalence of the luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ({HER}2), and triple-negative subtypes were 48.6\%, 16.7\%, 13.7\%, and 12.9\%, respectively. The luminal A subtype was more likely to be diagnosed in older women (P = 0.03) and had a stronger correlation with favorable clinicopathological factors (smaller tumor size, lower histologic grade, and earlier {TNM} stage) than the triple-negative or {HER}2 subtypes. Women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher frequency of family history of breast cancer than women with other subtypes (P = 0.048). The 5-year overall/disease-free survival percentages for the luminal A, luminal B, {HER}2, and triple-negative subtypes were 92.9\%/88.6\%, 88.6\%/85.1\%, 83.2\%/79.1\%, and 80.7\%/76.0\%, respectively. A similar pattern was observed in multivariate analyses. Immunotherapy was associated with improved overall and disease-free survival for luminal A breast cancer, but reduced disease-free survival ({HR} = 2.21, 95\% {CI}, 1.09-4.48) for the {HER}2 subtype of breast cancer.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The triple-negative and {HER}2 subtypes were associated with poorer outcomes compared with the luminal A subtype among these Chinese women. The {HER}2 subtype was more prevalent in this Chinese population compared with Western populations, suggesting the importance of standardized {HER}2 detection and anti-{HER}2 therapy to potentially benefit a high proportion of breast cancer patients in China.},

	abstract = {Within solid tumor microenvironments, lactic acidosis, and hypoxia each have powerful effects on cancer pathophysiology. However, the influence that these processes exert on each other is unknown. Here, we report that a significant portion of the transcriptional response to hypoxia elicited in cancer cells is abolished by simultaneous exposure to lactic acidosis. In particular, lactic acidosis abolished stabilization of {HIF}-1α protein which occurs normally under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, lactic acidosis strongly synergized with hypoxia to activate the unfolded protein response ({UPR}) and an inflammatory response, displaying a strong similarity to {ATF}4-driven amino acid deprivation responses ({AAR}). In certain breast tumors and breast tumor cells examined, an integrative analysis of gene expression and array {CGH} data revealed {DNA} copy number alterations at the {ATF}4 locus, an important activator of the {UPR}/{AAR} pathway. In this setting, varying {ATF}4 levels influenced the survival of cells after exposure to hypoxia and lactic acidosis. Our findings reveal that the condition of lactic acidosis present in solid tumors inhibits canonical hypoxia responses and activates {UPR} and inflammation responses. Furthermore, these data suggest that {ATF}4 status may be a critical determinant of the ability of cancer cells to adapt to oxygen and acidity fluctuations in the tumor microenvironment, perhaps linking short-term transcriptional responses to long-term selection for copy number alterations in cancer cells.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Between 1994 and 2007, of 968 patients with metastatic breast cancer who underwent palliative management at Samsung Medical Center, 565 (57\%) relapsed with distant metastases. Of the 968, 146 (15\%) had bone-only metastases during a median follow-up period of 75 months. Among the 146 patients with bone-only metastases, 122 (84\%) were relapsed patients after curative surgery and 24 (26\%) were initially metastatic cases.
{RESULTS}: The median time from primary surgery to bone-only metastases of the 122 patients was 37 months (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 27 to 46 months). Bone-only metastases were more common in the {HR}-positive group than in the other subtypes (85\% for {HR}+; 8.2\% for {HER}2+; 6.8\% for triple negative. Among all 146 patients, 75 (51\%) were treated with hormone therapy. The median post-relapse progression-free survival was 15 months (95\% {CI}, 13 to 17 months). The median overall survival was much longer in the {HR}+ patients than the {HER}2+ and triple negative breast cancer patients with marginal statistical significance (65 vs. 40 vs. 40 months, p=0.077).
{CONCLUSION}: Breast cancer patients with "bone-only metastases" had excellent clinical outcomes. Further study is now warranted to reveal the underlying biology that regulates the behavior of this indolent tumor, as it should identify 'favorable tumor characteristics' in addition to 'favorable preferential metastatic site.'},

Cancer genomes differ dramatically due to genetic and environmental factors. A major challenge in interpreting the large volume of mutation data identified in cancer genomes using next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) is to distinguish driver mutations from neutral passenger mutations. We propose a novel mutation network method, {VarWalker}, to prioritize driver genes in large scale cancer mutation data. Applying our approach in a large cohort of lung adenocarcinoma samples and melanoma samples, we derived a consensus mutation subnetwork for each cancer containing significantly enriched cancer genes and cancer-related functional pathways. Our results indicated that driver genes occur within a broad spectrum of frequency, interact with each other, and converge in several key pathways that play critical roles in tumorigenesis.},

We estimated incidence per 100,000 women by 10-year age groups, race, and ethnicity. We also assessed the percent change in invasive and in situ cancer incidence over time. {RESULTS}: We observed distinct differences in the change of incidence over time between in situ and invasive lobular and ductal breast cancers. The age-adjusted rates of {ILC} and {IDC} declined an average of 4.6\% and 3.3\% per year, respectively. Overall, {ILC} decreased 20.5\% from 1999 to 2004. The patterns of ductal and lobular in situ cancer incidence were not consistent over time, and the total change was negligible. {CONCLUSION}: The declines in {ILC} observed in our study are consistent with a decrease in cancer incidence related to a reduced use of combined hormone replacement therapy.

We found that 63\% of {BC} patients with advanced disease had bone metastases, and 44\% of those were {IBM}. The proportion of cases with {IBM} that expressed estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor (47/52; 90\%) was significantly higher than those with non-bone metastases (P {\textless} .0001) and than those with multiple metastases involving bone (P {\textless} .0001). The distribution of {BC} molecular subtypes in cases of {IBM} was again significantly different from that of the remainder. By univariate and multivariate analysis of the clinicopathologic factors examined, only estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status of the primary tumor was predictive for {IBM}.

Our results indicate that the diversity in receptor expression patterns not only reflects the biological diversity of mammary tumors but may also predict their metastatic potential and thus could potentially be used in surveying women patients with nonmetastatic disease.},

Given that the literature is dense and empirical benchmarking challenging, selecting an appropriate method for {ChIP}-seq analysis has become a daunting task. Herein we compare the performance of eleven different peak calling programs on common empirical, transcription factor datasets and measure their sensitivity, accuracy and usability.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0057799},
	abstract = {Although ovarian cancer is often initially chemotherapy-sensitive, the vast majority of tumors eventually relapse and patients die of increasingly aggressive disease. Cancer stem cells are believed to have properties that allow them to survive therapy and may drive recurrent tumor growth. Cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells are a rare cell population and difficult to isolate experimentally. Genes that are expressed by stem cells may characterize a subset of less differentiated tumors and aid in prognostic classification of ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was the genomic identification and characterization of a subtype of ovarian cancer that has stem cell-like gene expression. Using human and mouse gene signatures of embryonic, adult, or cancer stem cells, we performed an unsupervised bipartition class discovery on expression profiles from 145 serous ovarian tumors to identify a stem-like and more differentiated subgroup. Subtypes were reproducible and were further characterized in four independent, heterogeneous ovarian cancer datasets. We identified a stem-like subtype characterized by a 51-gene signature, which is significantly enriched in tumors with properties of Type {II} ovarian cancer; high grade, serous tumors, and poor survival. Conversely, the differentiated tumors share properties with Type I, including lower grade and mixed histological subtypes. The stem cell-like signature was prognostic within high-stage serous ovarian cancer, classifying a small subset of high-stage tumors with better prognosis, in the differentiated subtype. In multivariate models that adjusted for common clinical factors (including grade, stage, age), the subtype classification was still a significant predictor of relapse. The prognostic stem-like gene signature yields new insights into prognostic differences in ovarian cancer, provides a genomic context for defining Type I/{II} subtypes, and potential gene targets which following further validation may be valuable in the clinical management or treatment of ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {Breast tumors consist of several different tissue components. Despite the heterogeneity, most gene expression analyses have traditionally been performed without prior microdissection of the tissue sample. Thus, the gene expression profiles obtained reflect the {mRNA} contribution from the various tissue components. We utilized histopathological estimations of area fractions of tumor and stromal tissue components in 198 fresh-frozen breast tumor tissue samples for a cell type-associated gene expression analysis associated with distant metastasis. Sets of differentially expressed gene-probes were identified in tumors from patients who developed distant metastasis compared with those who did not, by weighing the contribution from each tumor with the relative content of stromal and tumor epithelial cells in their individual tumor specimen. The analyses were performed under various assumptions of {mRNA} transcription level from tumor epithelial cells compared with stromal cells. A set of 30 differentially expressed gene-probes was ascribed solely to carcinoma cells. Furthermore, two sets of 38 and five differentially expressed gene-probes were mostly associated to tumor epithelial and stromal cells, respectively. Finally, a set of 26 differentially expressed gene-probes was identified independently of cell type focus. The differentially expressed genes were validated in independent gene expression data from a set of laser capture microdissected invasive ductal carcinomas. We present a method for identifying and ascribing differentially expressed genes to tumor epithelial and/or stromal cells, by utilizing pathologic information and weighted t-statistics. Although a transcriptional contribution from the stromal cell fraction is detectable in microarray experiments performed on bulk tumor, the gene expression differences between the distant metastasis and no distant metastasis group were mostly ascribed to the tumor epithelial cells of the primary breast tumors. However, the gene {PIP}5K2A was found significantly elevated in stroma cells in distant metastasis group, compared to stroma in no distant metastasis group. These findings were confirmed in gene expression data from the representative compartments from microdissected breast tissue. The method described was also found to be robust to different histopathological procedures.},

Through cross-species analysis, we discovered mouse mammary tumors that have similar gene expression characteristics as human claudin-low tumors and were also enriched for the human {TIC} signature. Such claudin-low tumors were similarly rare but came from a number of distinct mouse models, including the p53 null transplant model. Here we present a molecular characterization of 50 p53 null mammary tumors compared with other mouse models and human breast tumor subtypes. Similar to human tumors, the murine p53 null tumors fell into multiple molecular subtypes, including two basal-like, a luminal, a claudin-low, and a subtype unique to this model. The claudin-low tumors also showed high gene expression of {EMT} inducers, low expression of the {miR}-200 family, and low to absent expression of both claudin 3 and E-cadherin. These murine subtypes also contained distinct genomic {DNA} copy number changes, some of which are similarly altered in their cognate human subtype counterpart. Finally, limiting dilution transplantation revealed that p53 null claudin-low tumors are highly enriched for {TICs} compared with the more common adenocarcinomas arising in the same model, thus providing a unique preclinical mouse model to investigate the therapeutic response of {TICs}.},

Recent studies show {microRNA}-223 ({miR}-223), a transcriptional target of C/{EBPalpha}, as a critical player during granulopoiesis.

Tissue microarrays were constructed from archived tissue blocks of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the {NHS} (1976-1997). Invasive non-metastatic breast cancer tumors (n = 1,945) were classified into 1 of 5 molecular phenotypes based on immunohistochemistry assays for estrogen receptor ({ER}), progesterone receptor ({PR}), {HER}2, cytokeratin ({CK}) 5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) and grade. Survival outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Cox-proportional hazards models were fitted to determine the association of molecular phenotype with survival outcomes after adjusting for covariates. 1,279 (65.8\%) tumors were classified as luminal A, 279 (14.3\%) as luminal B, 95 (4.9\%) as {HER}2 type, 203 (10.4\%) as basal-like and 89 (4.6\%) tumors were unclassified. The 5-year breast cancer-specific survival estimates for women with luminal A, luminal B, {HER}2-type, basal-like and unclassified tumors were 96, 88, 81, 89 and 85\%, respectively. In the multivariable model, compared to cases with luminal A tumors, cases with luminal B ({HR} 1.90, 95\% {CI} 1.33-2.71), {HER}2-type ({HR} 1.36, 95\% {CI} 0.87-2.12), basal-like ({HR} 1.58, 95\% {CI} 1.05-2.39) and unclassified ({HR} 1.38, 95\% {CI} 0.87-2.20) tumors had higher hazard of breast cancer death. Similar trends were observed for both overall and recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, compared to women who have luminal A tumors those with luminal B, {HER}2-type, basal-like and unclassified tumors had a worse prognosis, when tumor subtype was defined by immunohistochemistry.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}/{AIM}: The phenomenon of membrane vesicle-release by neoplastic cells is a growing field of interest in cancer research, due to their potential role in carrying a large array of tumor antigens when secreted into the extracellular medium. In particular, experimental evidence show that at least some of the tumor markers detected in the blood circulation of mammary carcinoma patients are carried by membrane-bound vesicles. Thus, biomarker research in breast cancer can gain great benefits from vesicle characterization.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Conditioned medium was collected from serum starved {MDA}-{MB}-231 sub-confluent cell cultures and exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Ultrastructural analysis of {ELVs} was performed by transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) and the purity of fraction was confirmed by western blotting assays. Proteomic profile of {ELVs} was carried out by 2 D-{PAGE} and protein identification performed by {MALDI}-{ToF} Mass Spectrometry.
{RESULTS}: On the basis of ultrastructural and immunological characterization, the isolated vesicles have been classified as exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}). The proteomic investigation showed a distinctive protein profile of the {ELVs}, in comparison to the whole cell lisates ({WCL}) proteome, which could be instrumental for cancer progression. The proteins were clustered into functional categories, according to the current bioinformatics resources and a Venn diagram was constructed based on these clusters.
{CONCLUSION}: It is reasonable to assume that vesicle production allows neoplastic cells to exert different effects, according to the possible acceptor targets. For instance, vesicles could potentiate the malignant properties of adjacent neoplastic cells or activate non-tumoral cells. Moreover, vesicles could convey signals to immune cells and surrounding stroma cells. The present study may significantly contribute to the knowledge of the vesiculation phenomenon, which is a critical device for trans cellular communication in cancer.},

	abstract = {Accurate prognosis and prediction of response to therapy are essential for personalized treatment of cancer. Even though many prognostic gene lists and predictors have been proposed, especially for breast cancer, high-throughput "omic" methods have so far not revolutionized clinical practice, and their clinical utility has not been satisfactorily established. Different prognostic gene lists have very few shared genes, the biological meaning of most signatures is unclear, and the published success rates are considered to be overoptimistic. This review examines critically the manner in which prognostic classifiers are derived using machine-learning methods and suggests reasons for the shortcomings and problems listed above. Two approaches that may hold hope for obtaining improved prognosis are presented. Both are based on using existing prior knowledge; one proposes combining molecular "omic" predictors with established clinical ones, and the second infers biologically relevant pathway deregulation scores for each tumor from expression data, and uses this representation to study and stratify individual tumors. Approaches such as the second one are referred to in the physics literature as "phenomenology"; they will, hopefully, play a significant role in future studies of cancer.

Furthermore, we identify a number of methodological challenges that the next generation of methods must tackle to take advantage of the technological advances in genomics and proteomics in order to improve specificity, sensitivity, and relevance of pathway analysis.},

However, disruption of this mutualistic relationship can manifest itself in human diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. Thus the study of inflammatory bowel disease and its genetics can provide insight into host pathways that mediate host-microbiota symbiosis. Bacteria of the human intestinal ecosystem face numerous challenges imposed by human dietary intake, the mucosal immune system, competition from fellow members of the gut microbiota, transient ingested microbes and invading pathogens. Considering features of human resident gut bacteria provides the opportunity to understand how microbes have achieved their symbiont status. While model symbionts have provided perspective into host-microbial homeostasis, high-throughput approaches are becoming increasingly practical for functionally characterizing the gut microbiota as a community.},

To achieve this, several functional profiling methods have been proposed. Such methods study the behaviour of different gene modules (e.g. gene ontology terms) in response to one particular variable (e.g. differential gene expression). In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples. Our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for the discovery of new cell functionalities with complex dependences on more than one variable.},

This represents an increase of about 25\% over previously known participants. Nearly half of these newly characterized proteins are conserved in mammals, including several orthologs known to be involved in human disease. Mutations in many of these genes demonstrate statistically significant mitochondrial transmission phenotypes more subtle than could be detected by traditional genetic screens or high-throughput techniques, and 47 have not been previously localized to mitochondria. We further characterized a subset of these genes using growth profiling and dual immunofluorescence, which identified genes specifically required for aerobic respiration and an uncharacterized cytoplasmic protein required for normal mitochondrial motility. Our results demonstrate that by leveraging computational analysis to direct quantitative experimental assays, we have characterized mutants with subtle mitochondrial defects whose phenotypes were undetected by high-throughput methods.},

To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant ({MCF}10A) and a breast cancer derived ({MDA}-{MB}231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues ({NAF}) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts ({CAF}), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In {MDA}-{MB}231 highly represented genes downregulated by {CAF} derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between {ER} and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of {MCF}10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While {NAF} downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in {MDA}-{MB}231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in {MCF}10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. {NAFs} responded to coculture with {MDA}-{MB}231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by {TGFbeta}1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in {NAFs} gene expression profile influenced by {MCF}10A. {CAFs} responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation.

Nonnegative matrix factorization ({NMF}) was introduced as an unsupervised, parts-based learning paradigm involving the decomposition of a nonnegative matrix V into two nonnegative matrices, W and H, via a multiplicative updates algorithm. In the context of a pxn gene expression matrix V consisting of observations on p genes from n samples, each column of W defines a metagene, and each column of H represents the metagene expression pattern of the corresponding sample. {NMF} has been primarily applied in an unsupervised setting in image and natural language processing. More recently, it has been successfully utilized in a variety of applications in computational biology. Examples include molecular pattern discovery, class comparison and prediction, cross-platform and cross-species analysis, functional characterization of genes and biomedical informatics. In this paper, we review this method as a data analytical and interpretive tool in computational biology with an emphasis on these applications.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: High-throughput gene expression profiling technologies generating a wealth of data, are increasingly used for characterization of tumor biopsies for clinical trials. By applying machine learning algorithms to such clinically documented data sets, one hopes to improve tumor diagnosis, prognosis, as well as prediction of treatment response. However, the limited number of patients enrolled in a single trial study limits the power of machine learning approaches due to over-fitting. One could partially overcome this limitation by merging data from different studies. Nevertheless, such data sets differ from each other with regard to technical biases, patient selection criteria and follow-up treatment. It is therefore not clear at all whether the advantage of increased sample size outweighs the disadvantage of higher heterogeneity of merged data sets. Here, we present a systematic study to answer this question specifically for breast cancer data sets. We use survival prediction based on Cox regression as an assay to measure the added value of merged data sets. {RESULTS}: Using time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve ({ROC}-{AUC}) and hazard ratio as performance measures, we see in overall no significant improvement or deterioration of survival prediction with merged data sets as compared to individual data sets. This apparently was due to the fact that a few genes with strong prognostic power were not available on all microarray platforms and thus were not retained in the merged data sets. Surprisingly, we found that the overall best performance was achieved with a single-gene predictor consisting of {CYB}5D1. {CONCLUSIONS}: Merging did not deteriorate performance on average despite (a) The diversity of microarray platforms used. (b) The heterogeneity of patients cohorts. (c) The heterogeneity of breast cancer disease. (d) Substantial variation of time to death or relapse. (e) The reduced number of genes in the merged data sets. Predictors derived from the merged data sets were more robust, consistent and reproducible across microarray platforms. Moreover, merging data sets from different studies helps to better understand the biases of individual studies and can lead to the identification of strong survival factors like {CYB}5D1 expression.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Lymphocytic infiltration of tumors predicts improved survival in breast cancer patients. Previous studies have suggested that this survival benefit is confined predominantly to the basal-like subtype. Immune infiltration in ovarian tumors is also associated with improved prognosis. Currently, it is unclear what aspects of the immune response mediate this improved outcome. Experimental Design: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) {mRNA}-seq data and a large microarray data set, we evaluated adaptive immune gene expression by genomic subtype in breast and ovarian cancer. To investigate B-cells observed to be prognostic within specific subtypes, we developed methods to analyze B-cell population diversity and degree of somatic hypermutation ({SHM}) from B-cell receptor ({BCR}) sequences in {mRNA}-seq data. Results: Improved metastasis-free/progression-free survival was correlated with B-cell gene expression signatures, which were restricted mainly to the basal-like and {HER}2-enriched breast cancer subtypes and the immunoreactive ovarian cancer subtype. Consistent with a restricted epitope-driven response, a subset of basal-like and {HER}2-enriched breast tumors and immunoreactive ovarian tumors showed high expression of a low-diversity population of {BCR} gene segments. More {BCR} segments showed improved prognosis with increased expression in basal-like breast tumors and immunoreactive ovarian tumors compared with other subtypes. Basal-like and {HER}2-enriched tumors exhibited more {BCR} sequence variants in regions consistent with somatic hypermutation. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest the presence of a productive and potentially restricted anti-tumor B-cell response in basal-like breast and immunoreactive ovarian cancers. Immunomodulatory therapies that support B-cell responses may be a promising therapeutic approach to targeting these B-cell infiltrated tumors.},

{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Integration of {miRNA} and gene patterns yielded evidence that proximal pairs of {miRNAs} are processed from polycistronic primary transcripts, and that intronic {miRNAs} and their host gene {mRNAs} derive from common transcripts. Patterns of {miRNA} expression revealed multiple tumor subtypes and a set of 34 {miRNAs} predictive of overall patient survival. In a global analysis, {miRNA}:{mRNA} pairs anti-correlated in expression across tumors showed a higher frequency of in silico predicted target sites in the {mRNA} 3'-untranslated region (with less frequency observed for coding sequence and 5'-untranslated regions). The {miR}-29 family and predicted target genes were among the most strongly anti-correlated {miRNA}:{mRNA} pairs; over-expression of {miR}-29a in vitro repressed several anti-correlated genes (including {DNMT}3A and {DNMT}3B) and substantially decreased ovarian cancer cell viability.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study establishes {miRNAs} as having a widespread impact on gene expression programs in ovarian cancer, further strengthening our understanding of {miRNA} biology as it applies to human cancer. As with gene transcripts, {miRNAs} exhibit high diversity reflecting the genomic heterogeneity within a clinically homogeneous disease population. Putative {miRNA}:{mRNA} interactions, as identified using integrative analysis, can be validated. {TCGA} data are a valuable resource for the identification of novel tumor suppressive {miRNAs} in ovarian as well as other cancers.},

The interpretation of the distance Δ(Pi, Pj) between the ith and jth members of the sample is discussed for some commonly used types of analysis, including both Q and R techniques. When all the distances between n points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean sapce is found. Q and R techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of n points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived. In factor analysis the distances between points whose co-ordinrates are the estimated factor scores can be interpreted as D2 with a singular dispersion matrix.},

Understanding the mechanisms driving the subtypes may be key in development of novel therapeutics but is challenged by lineage-specific expression signals. Using a t-test statistics approach, we compared gene expression subtypes across 12 tumor types, which identified eight transcriptional superclusters characterized by commonly activated disease pathways and similarities in gene expression. One of the largest superclusters was determined by the upregulation of a proliferation signature, significant enrichment in {TP}53 mutations, genomic loss of {CDKN}2A (p16ARF), evidence of increased numbers of {DNA} double strand breaks and high expression of cyclin B1 protein. These correlations suggested that abrogation of the P53-mediated apoptosis response to {DNA} damage results in activation of cell cycle pathways and represents a common theme in cancer. A second consistent pattern, observed in 9 of 11 solid tumor types, was a subtype related to an activated tumor-associated stroma. The similarity in transcriptional footprints across cancers suggested that tumor subtypes are commonly unified by a limited number of molecular themes.},

Exosomes are secreted microvesicles that are emerging as potent mediators of cell–cell communication that are of particular importance in tumor–stroma interactions. The Wnt-planar cell polarity ({PCP}) pathway is the primary regulator of convergent extension cell movements during vertebrate development, but the role of this signaling pathway in cancer cell migration and metastasis has been unclear. Recently, we revealed that fibroblasts secrete exosomes that promote breast cancer cell ({BCC}) protrusive activity, motility, and metastasis by activating autocrine Wnt-{PCP} signaling in {BCCs}. Moreover, we showed that Wnt ligands produced by {BCCs} tether to fibroblast exosomes upon trafficking of exosomes in {BCCs}. These findings have several implications that motivate promising future research in the fields of tumor–stroma communication, exosome function, and Wnt-{PCP} signaling in cancer metastasis.

However, the overall burden of disease due to either inherited or sporadic mutations is not known.  	We performed bioinformatics analyses of mutational and clinical data of 334 {HG}-{SOC} tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify novel tumor-driving mutations, survival-significant patient subgroups and tumor subtypes potentially driven by either hereditary or sporadic factors.  	We identified a sub-cluster of high-frequency mutations in 22 patients and 58 genes associated with {DNA} damage repair, apoptosis and cell cycle. Mutations of {CHEK}2, observed with the highest intensity, were associated with poor therapy response and overall survival ({OS}) of these patients (P = 8.00e-05), possibly due to detrimental effect of mutations at the nuclear localization signal. A 21-gene mutational prognostic signature significantly stratifies patients into relatively low or high-risk subgroups with 5-y {OS} of 37\% or 6\%, respectively (P = 7.31e-08). Further analysis of these genes and high-risk subgroup revealed 2 distinct classes of tumors characterized by either germline mutations of genes such as {CHEK}2, {RPS}6KA2 and {MLL}4, or somatic mutations of other genes in the signature.  	Our results could provide improvement in prediction and clinical management of {HG}-{SOC}, facilitate our understanding of this complex disease, guide the design of targeted therapeutics and improve screening efforts to identify women at high-risk of hereditary ovarian cancers distinct from those associated with {BRCA}1/2 mutations.},

Tissue microarrays ({TMAs}) facilitate the validation of biomarkers by offering a high-throughput approach to sample analysis. We reanalyzed a high profile breast cancer {DNA} microarray dataset containing 96 tumor samples using a powerful statistical approach, between group analyses. Among the genes we identified was centromere protein-F ({CENP}-F), a gene associated with poor prognosis. In a published follow-up breast cancer {DNA} microarray study, comprising 295 tumour samples, we found that {CENP}-F upregulation was significantly associated with worse overall survival (p{\textless}0.001) and reduced metastasis-free survival (p{\textless}0.001). To validate and expand upon these findings, we used 2 independent breast cancer patient cohorts represented on {TMAs}. {CENP}-F protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 91 primary breast cancer samples from cohort I and 289 samples from cohort {II}. {CENP}-F correlated with markers of aggressive tumor behavior including {ER} negativity and high tumor grade. In cohort I, {CENP}-F was significantly associated with markers of {CIN} including cyclin E, increased telomerase activity, c-Myc amplification and aneuploidy. In cohort {II}, {CENP}-F correlated with {VEGFR}2, phosphorylated Ets-2 and Ki67, and in multivariate analysis, was an independent predictor of worse breast cancer-specific survival (p=0.036) and overall survival (p=0.040).

The main goal of our current investigations was to identify slow-cycling (quiescent) endometrial stem cells by means of a pulse-chase approach to selectively earmark, prospectively isolate, and characterize label-retaining cells ({LRCs}). To this aim, transgenic mice expressing histone2B-{GFP} (H2B-{GFP}) in a Tet-inducible fashion were administered doxycycline (pulse) which was thereafter withdrawn from the drinking water (chase). Over time, dividing cells progressively loose {GFP} signal whereas infrequently dividing cells retain H2B-{GFP} expression. We evaluated H2B-{GFP} retaining cells at different chase time points and identified long-term ({LT}; {\textgreater}12 weeks) {LRCs}. The {LT}-{LRCs} are negative for estrogen receptor-α and express low levels of progesterone receptors. {LRCs} sorted by {FACS} are able to form spheroids capable of self-renewal and differentiation. Upon serum stimulation spheroid cells are induced to differentiate and form glandular structures which express markers of mature Műllerian epithelial cells. Overall, the results indicate that quiescent cells located in the distal oviduct have stem-like properties and can differentiate into distinct cell lineages specific of endometrium, proximal and distal oviduct. Future lineage-tracing studies will elucidate the role played by these cells in homeostasis, tissue injury and cancer of the female reproductive tract in the mouse and eventually in man.},

Placental mesenchymal stem cells ({pMSC}) are known to release paracrine factors (some of which are contained within exosomes) that promote angiogenesis and cell migration. The aims of this study were: to determine the effects of oxygen tension on the release of exosomes from {pMSC}; and to establish the effects of {pMSC}-derived exosomes on the migration and angiogenic tube formation of placental microvascular endothelial cells ({hPMEC}). {pMSC} were isolated from placental villi (8–12 weeks of gestation, n = 6) and cultured under an atmosphere of 1\%, 3\% or 8\% O2. Cell-conditioned media were collected and exosomes (exo-{pMSC}) isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. The dose effect (5–20 µg exosomal protein/ml) of {pMSC}-derived exosomes on {hPMEC} migration and tube formation were established using a real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™). The exosome pellet was resuspended in {PBS} and protein content was established by mass spectrometry ({MS}). Protein function and canonical pathways were identified using the {PANTHER} program and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, respectively. Exo-{pMSC} were identified, by electron microscopy, as spherical vesicles, with a typical cup-shape and diameters around of 100 nm and positive for exosome markers: {CD}63, {CD}9 and {CD}81. Under hypoxic conditions (1\% and 3\% O2) exo-{pMSC} released increased by 3.3 and 6.7 folds, respectively, when compared to the controls (8\% O2; p{\textless}0.01). Exo-{pMSC} increased {hPMEC} migration by 1.6 fold compared to the control (p{\textless}0.05) and increased {hPMEC} tube formation by 7.2 fold (p{\textless}0.05). {MS} analysis identified 390 different proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization, development, immunomodulatory, and cell-to-cell communication. The data obtained support the hypothesis that {pMSC}-derived exosomes may contribute to placental vascular adaptation to low oxygen tension under both physiological and pathological conditions.},

Whole tumour and parenchymal samples demonstrated differential gene expression, with 289 genes significantly overexpressed in the whole tumour, many of which were consistent with stromal gene expression (e.g., {COL}6A3, {COL}1A2, {POSTN}, {TIMP}2). Genes characteristic of colorectal carcinoma were overexpressed in the {FACS}-purified cells (e.g., {HOX}2D and {RHOB}).

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed {CRC} expression data from patient-derived xenografts, where mouse stroma supports human cancer cells. Species-specific expression analysis showed that the {mRNA} levels of {SSM} genes were mostly due to stromal expression. Transcriptional signatures built to specifically report the abundance of cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAFs}), leukocytes or endothelial cells all had significantly higher expression in human {CRC} samples of the {SSM} subtype. High expression of the {CAF} signature was associated with poor prognosis in untreated {CRC}, and joint high expression of the stromal signatures predicted resistance to radiotherapy in rectal cancer.

Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five {MGU}74A mouse {GeneChip} arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 {HG}-U95A human {GeneChip} arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 {HG}-U95A {GeneChip} arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe ({PM} and {MM}) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the {PM} and {MM} using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference ({AvDiff}) and (ii) {MAS} 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index ({MBEI}). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average ({RMA}) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed {PM} values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for {MBEI} and {RMA}) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using {RMA} and attaching a standard error ({SE}) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Previous studies have demonstrated that common breast cancer susceptibility alleles are differentially associated with breast cancer risk for {BRCA}1 and/or {BRCA}2 mutation carriers. It is currently unknown how these alleles are associated with different breast cancer subtypes in {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 mutation carriers defined by estrogen ({ER}) or progesterone receptor ({PR}) status of the tumour.
{METHODS}: We used genotype data on up to 11,421 {BRCA}1 and 7,080 {BRCA}2 carriers, of whom 4,310 had been affected with breast cancer and had information on either {ER} or {PR} status of the tumour, to assess the associations of 12 loci with breast cancer tumour characteristics. Associations were evaluated using a retrospective cohort approach.
{RESULTS}: The results suggested stronger associations with {ER}-positive breast cancer than {ER}-negative for 11 loci in both {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 carriers. Among {BRCA}1 carriers, single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) rs2981582 ({FGFR}2) exhibited the biggest difference based on {ER} status (per-allele hazard ratio ({HR}) for {ER}-positive = 1.35, 95\% {CI}: 1.17 to 1.56 vs {HR} = 0.91, 95\% {CI}: 0.85 to 0.98 for {ER}-negative, P-heterogeneity = 6.5 × 10-6). In contrast, {SNP} rs2046210 at 6q25.1 near {ESR}1 was primarily associated with {ER}-negative breast cancer risk for both {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 carriers. In {BRCA}2 carriers, {SNPs} in {FGFR}2, {TOX}3, {LSP}1, {SLC}4A7/{NEK}10, 5p12, 2q35, and 1p11.2 were significantly associated with {ER}-positive but not {ER}-negative disease. Similar results were observed when differentiating breast cancer cases by {PR} status.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The associations of the 12 {SNPs} with risk for {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 carriers differ by {ER}-positive or {ER}-negative breast cancer status. The apparent differences in {SNP} associations between {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 carriers, and non-carriers, may be explicable by differences in the prevalence of tumour subtypes. As more risk modifying variants are identified, incorporating these associations into breast cancer subtype-specific risk models may improve clinical management for mutation carriers.},

	volume = {7},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0047108},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

While the conserved positions of a multiple sequence alignment ({MSA}) are clearly of interest, non-conserved positions can also be important because, for example, destabilizing effects at one position can be compensated by stabilizing effects at another position. Different methods have been developed to recognize the evolutionary relationship between amino acid sites, and to disentangle functional/structural dependencies from historical/phylogenetic ones.


{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}

We have used two complementary approaches to test the efficacy of these methods. In the first approach, we have used a new program, {MSAvolve}, for the in silico evolution of {MSAs}, which records a detailed history of all covarying positions, and builds a global coevolution matrix as the accumulated sum of individual matrices for the positions forced to co-vary, the recombinant coevolution, and the stochastic coevolution. We have simulated over 1600 {MSAs} for 8 protein families, which reflect sequences of different sizes and proteins with widely different functions. The calculated coevolution matrices were compared with the coevolution matrices obtained for the same evolved {MSAs} with different coevolution detection methods. In a second approach we have evaluated the capacity of the different methods to predict close contacts in the representative X-ray structures of an additional 150 protein families using only experimental {MSAs}.


{CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}

Methods based on the identification of global correlations between pairs were found to be generally superior to methods based only on local correlations in their capacity to identify coevolving residues using either simulated or experimental {MSAs}. However, the significant variability in the performance of different methods with different proteins suggests that the simulation of {MSAs} that replicate the statistical properties of the experimental {MSA} can be a valuable tool to identify the coevolution detection method that is most effective in each case.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Gene set analysis has become an important tool for the functional interpretation of high-throughput gene expression datasets. Moreover, pattern analyses based on inferred gene set activities of individual samples have shown the ability to identify more robust disease signatures than individual gene-based pattern analyses. Although a number of approaches have been proposed for gene set-based pattern analysis, the combinatorial influence of deregulated gene sets on disease phenotype classification has not been studied sufficiently.Results: We propose a new approach for inferring combinatorial Boolean rules of gene sets for a better understanding of cancer transcriptome and cancer classification. To reduce the search space of the possible Boolean rules, we identify small groups of gene sets that synergistically contribute to the classification of samples into their corresponding phenotypic groups (such as normal and cancer). We then measure the significance of the candidate Boolean rules derived from each group of gene sets; the level of significance is based on the class entropy of the samples selected in accordance with the rules. By applying the present approach to publicly available prostate cancer datasets, we identified 72 significant Boolean rules. Finally, we discuss several identified Boolean rules, such as the rule of glutathione metabolism (down) and prostaglandin synthesis regulation (down), which are consistent with known prostate cancer biology.Availability: Scripts written in Python and R are available at http://biosoft.kaist.ac.kr/∼ihpark/.

This paper describes the application of self-organizing maps, a type of mathematical cluster analysis that is particularly well suited for recognizing and classifying features in complex, multidimensional data. The method has been implemented in a publicly available computer package, {GENECLUSTER}, that performs the analytical calculations and provides easy data visualization. To illustrate the value of such analysis, the approach is applied to hematopoietic differentiation in four well studied models ({HL}-60, U937, Jurkat, and {NB}4 cells). Expression patterns of some 6,000 human genes were assayed, and an online database was created. {GENECLUSTER} was used to organize the genes into biologically relevant clusters that suggest novel hypotheses about hematopoietic differentiation-for example, highlighting certain genes and pathways involved in "differentiation therapy" used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.},

Reformulating this multilinear {HOSVD} such that it decomposes the data tensor into a linear superposition of all outer products of an eigenarray, an x- and a y-eigengene, that is, rank-1 "subtensors," we define the significance of each subtensor in terms of the fraction of the overall information in the data tensor that it captures. We illustrate this {HOSVD} with an integration of genome-scale {mRNA} expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: High throughput 'omics' experiments are usually designed to compare changes observed between different conditions (or interventions) and to identify biomarkers capable of characterizing each condition. We consider the complex structure of repeated measurements from different assays where different conditions are applied on the same subjects.
{RESULTS}: We propose a two-step analysis combining a multilevel approach and a multivariate approach to reveal separately the effects of conditions within subjects from the biological variation between subjects. The approach is extended to two-factor designs and to the integration of two matched data sets. It allows internal variable selection to highlight genes able to discriminate the net condition effect within subjects. A simulation study was performed to demonstrate the good performance of the multilevel multivariate approach compared to a classical multivariate method. The multilevel multivariate approach outperformed the classical multivariate approach with respect to the classification error rate and the selection of relevant genes. The approach was applied to an {HIV}-vaccine trial evaluating the response with gene expression and cytokine secretion. The discriminant multilevel analysis selected a relevant subset of genes while the integrative multilevel analysis highlighted clusters of genes and cytokines that were highly correlated across the samples.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our combined multilevel multivariate approach may help in finding signatures of vaccine effect and allows for a better understanding of immunological mechanisms activated by the intervention. The integrative analysis revealed clusters of genes, that were associated with cytokine secretion. These clusters can be seen as gene signatures to predict future cytokine response. The approach is implemented in the R package {mixOmics} (http://cran.r-project.org/) with associated tutorials to perform the analysis(a).},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

A novel method of microarray preprocessing--Frozen Robust Multi-array Analysis ({fRMA})--has recently been developed. This algorithm allows the user to preprocess arrays individually while retaining the advantages of multi-array preprocessing methods. The frozen parameter estimates required by this algorithm are generated using a large database of publicly available arrays. Curation of such a database and creation of the frozen parameter estimates is time-consuming; therefore, {fRMA} has only been implemented on the most widely used Affymetrix platforms.


{RESULTS}

We present an R package, {frmaTools}, that allows the user to quickly create his or her own frozen parameter vectors. We describe how this package fits into a preprocessing workflow and explore the size of the training dataset needed to generate reliable frozen parameter estimates. This is followed by a discussion of specific situations in which one might wish to create one's own {fRMA} implementation. For a few specific scenarios, we demonstrate that {fRMA} performs well even when a large database of arrays in unavailable.


{CONCLUSIONS}

By allowing the user to easily create his or her own {fRMA} implementation, the {frmaTools} package greatly increases the applicability of the {fRMA} algorithm. The {frmaTools} package is freely available as part of the Bioconductor project.},

In this study, we report that {TN} breast cancer cells are more sensitive to these drugs compared with non-{TN} breast cancer cells. Moreover, combination treatments indicated that {PARP} inhibition by the small-molecule inhibitor {PJ}34 or {siRNA} knockdown synergized with gemcitabine and cisplatin in {TN} cells but not in luminal cancer cells. {TN} cells exhibited reduced repair of {UV}-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers after {PARP} inhibition, suggesting that the synergistic effect of {PJ}34 and gemcitabine or cisplatin reflected inefficient nucleotide excision repair. Mechanistic investigations revealed that in {TN} cells, {PJ}34 reduced the levels of ΔNp63α with a concurrent increase in p73 and its downstream target p21. Thus, the sensitivity to combination treatment seemed to be mediated by sustained {DNA} damage and inefficient {DNA} repair triggering p63/p73-mediated apoptosis.

	doi = {10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0857},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

High-grade serous cancer ({HGSC}) is the most common cancer of the ovary and is characterized by chromosomal instability. Defects in homologous recombination repair ({HRR}) are associated with genomic instability in {HGSC}, and are exploited by therapy targeting {DNA} repair. Defective {HRR} causes uniparental deletions and loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}). Our purpose is to profile {LOH} in {HGSC} and correlate our findings to clinical outcome, and compare {HGSC} and high-grade breast cancers.


{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}

We examined {LOH} and copy number changes using single nucleotide polymorphism array data from three {HGSC} cohorts and compared results to a cohort of high-grade breast cancers. The {LOH} profiles in {HGSC} were matched to chemotherapy resistance and progression-free survival ({PFS}).


{RESULTS}

{LOH}-based clustering divided {HGSC} into two clusters. The major group displayed extensive {LOH} and was further divided into two subgroups. The second group contained remarkably less {LOH}. {BRCA}1 promoter methylation was associated with the major group. {LOH} clusters were reproducible when validated in two independent {HGSC} datasets. {LOH} burden in the major cluster of {HGSC} was similar to triple-negative, and distinct from other high-grade breast cancers. Our analysis revealed an {LOH} cluster with lower treatment resistance and a significant correlation between {LOH} burden and {PFS}.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Separating {HGSC} by {LOH}-based clustering produces remarkably stable subgroups in three different cohorts. Patients in the various {LOH} clusters differed with respect to chemotherapy resistance, and the extent of {LOH} correlated with {PFS}. {LOH} burden may indicate vulnerability to treatment targeting {DNA} repair, such as {PARP}1 inhibitors.},

	abstract = {The establishment of metastasis depends on the ability of cancer cells to acquire a migratory phenotype combined with their capacity to recreate a secondary tumor in a distant tissue. In epithelial cancers, such as those of the breast, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ({EMT}) is associated with basal-like breast cancers, generates cells with stem-like properties, and enables cancer cell dissemination and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism(s) that connects stem cell-like characteristics with {EMT} has yet to be defined. Using an orthotopic model of human breast cancer metastasis to lung, we identified a poor prognosis gene signature, in which several components of the wnt signaling pathway were overexpressed in early lung metastases. The wnt genes identified in this signature were strongly associated with human basal-like breast cancers. We found that inhibiting wnt signaling through {LRP}6 reduced the capacity of cancer cells to self-renew and seed tumors in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of wnt signaling resulted in the reexpression of breast epithelial differentiation markers and repression of {EMT} transcription factors {SLUG} and {TWIST}. Collectively, these results provide a molecular link between self-renewal, {EMT}, and metastasis in basal-like breast cancers.},

Importantly, a synthetic {PI}3K inhibitor also increases energy expenditure and hyperactivates the {BAT} in mice. These effects can be recapitulated in isolated brown adipocytes and, moreover, implants of Pten(tg) fibroblasts programmed with Prdm16 and Cebpβ form subcutaneous brown adipose pads more efficiently than wild-type fibroblasts.

We hypothesized that changes in gene expression profiles within the histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium of {BRCA}1 mutation carriers would overlap with the expression profiles in {BRCA}1-mutated ovarian carcinomas and represent a {BRCA}1 preneoplastic signature. Laser capture microdissection of frozen sections was used to isolate neoplastic cells or histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium, and expression profiles were generated on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 gene expression arrays. Normal-risk controls were 11 women wild type for {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 ({WT}-{FT}). {WT}-{FT} were compared with histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium from seven women with deleterious {BRCA}1 mutations who had foci of at least intraepithelial neoplasm within their fallopian tube (B1-{FTocc}). {WT}-{FT} samples were also compared with 12 {BRCA}1 ovarian carcinomas (B1-{CA}). The comparison of {WT}-{FT} versus B1-{FTocc} resulted in 152 differentially expressed probe sets, and the comparison of {WT}-{FT} versus B1-{CA} resulted in 4079 differentially expressed probe sets. The {BRCA}1 preneoplastic signature was composed of the overlap between these two lists, which included 41 concordant probe sets. Genes in the {BRCA}1 preneoplastic signature included several known tumor suppressor genes such as {CDKN}1C and {EFEMP}1 and several thought to be important in invasion and metastasis such as E2F3.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Cancer cells have altered metabolism, with increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and biomass production. This study conducted genomic and metabolomic analyses to elucidate how tumor and stromal genomic characteristics influence tumor metabolism.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Thirty-three breast tumors and six normal breast tissues were analyzed by gene expression microarray and by mass spectrometry for metabolites. Gene expression data and clinical characteristics were evaluated in association with metabolic phenotype. To evaluate the role of stromal interactions in altered metabolism, cocultures were conducted using breast cancer cells and primary cancer-associated fibroblasts ({CAF}).
{RESULTS}: Across all metabolites, unsupervised clustering resulted in two main sample clusters. Normal breast tissue and a subset of tumors with less aggressive clinical characteristics had lower levels of nucleic and amino acids and glycolysis byproducts, whereas more aggressive tumors had higher levels of these Warburg-associated metabolites. While tumor-intrinsic subtype did not predict metabolic phenotype, metabolic cluster was significantly associated with expression of a wound response signature. In cocultures, {CAFs} from basal-like breast cancers increased glucose uptake and basal-like epithelial cells increased glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis, suggesting interplay of stromal and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism. Cytokine arrays identified hepatocyte growth factor ({HGF}) as a potential mediator of stromal-epithelial interaction and antibody neutralization of {HGF} resulted in reduced expression of glucose transporter 1 ({GLUT}1) and decreased glucose uptake by epithelium.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Both tumor/epithelial and stromal characteristics play important roles in metabolism. Warburg-like metabolism is influenced by changes in stromal-epithelial interactions, including altered expression of {HGF}/Met pathway and {GLUT}1 expression.},

In colorectal cancer, it has been found that the amount of stroma within the primary tumor is of prognostic value. We therefore have evaluated the prognostic value of this tumor–stroma ratio for breast cancer. A cohort of 574 early breast cancer patients, primarily treated with surgery between 1985 and 1994 was analyzed for the tumor–stroma ratio. The percentage of stroma was visually estimated on Haematoxylin-Eosin (H\&E) stained histological sections. Patients with more than 50\% intra-tumor stroma were quantified as stroma rich and patients with less than 50\% as stroma poor. For the total group of patients, stroma-rich tumors had a shorter relapse-free period ({RFP}) (P = 0.001) and overall survival ({OS}) (P = 0.025) compared to stroma-poor tumors. Tumor–stroma ratio was an independent prognostic parameter for the total group of patients (P {\textless} 0.001) and also in stratified analysis based on systemic treatment. Importantly, in the triple-negative cancer subpopulation, patients with stroma-rich tumors had a 2.92 times higher risk of relapse (P = 0.006) compared to those with stroma-poor tumors, independently of other clinico-pathological parameters. Five-year {RFP}-rates for triple-negative cancer patients with stroma-rich compared to stroma-poor tumors were 56 and 81\%, respectively. Tumor–stroma ratio has proven to be an independent prognostic factor for {RFP} in breast cancer patients and especially in the triple-negative cancer subpopulation. Tumor–stroma ratio could be easily implemented in routine daily pathology diagnostics, as it is simple to determine, reproducible, and performed in quick time.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Conditioned medium was collected from serum starved {MDA}-{MB}-231 sub-confluent cell cultures and exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}) were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Ultrastructural analysis of {ELVs} was performed by transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) and the purity of fraction was confirmed by western blotting assays. Proteomic profile of {ELVs} was carried out by 2 D-{PAGE} and protein identification performed by {MALDI}-{ToF} Mass Spectrometry.
{RESULTS}: On the basis of ultrastructural and immunological characterization, the isolated vesicles have been classified as exosome-like vesicles ({ELVs}). The proteomic investigation showed a distinctive protein profile of the {ELVs}, in comparison to the whole cell lisates ({WCL}) proteome, which could be instrumental for cancer progression. The proteins were clustered into functional categories, according to the current bioinformatics resources and a Venn diagram was constructed based on these clusters.
{CONCLUSION}: It is reasonable to assume that vesicle production allows neoplastic cells to exert different effects, according to the possible acceptor targets. For instance, vesicles could potentiate the malignant properties of adjacent neoplastic cells or activate non-tumoral cells. Moreover, vesicles could convey signals to immune cells and surrounding stroma cells. The present study may significantly contribute to the knowledge of the vesiculation phenomenon, which is a critical device for trans cellular communication in cancer.},

One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.},

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0017474},
	abstract = {Microarray experiments have been extensively used to define signatures, which are sets of genes that can be considered markers of experimental conditions (typically diseases). Paradoxically, in spite of the apparent functional role that might be attributed to such gene sets, signatures do not seem to be reproducible across experiments. Given the close relationship between function and protein interaction, network properties can be used to study to what extent signatures are composed of genes whose resulting proteins show a considerable level of interaction (and consequently a putative common functional role).

We have analysed 618 signatures and 507 modules of co-expression in cancer looking for significant values of four main protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) network parameters: connection degree, cluster coefficient, betweenness and number of components. A total of 3904 gene ontology ({GO}) modules, 146 {KEGG} pathways, and 263 Biocarta pathways have been used as functional modules of reference.

Co-expression modules found in microarray experiments display a high level of connectivity, similar to the one shown by conventional modules based on functional definitions ({GO}, {KEGG} and Biocarta). A general observation for all the classes studied is that the networks formed by the modules improve their topological parameters when an external protein is allowed to be introduced within the paths (up to the 70\% of {GO} modules show network parameters beyond the random expectation). This fact suggests that functional definitions are incomplete and some genes might still be missing. Conversely, signatures are clearly not capturing the altered functions in the corresponding studies. This is probably because the way in which the genes have been selected in the signatures is too conservative. These results suggest that gene selection methods which take into account relationships among genes should be superior to methods that assume independence among genes outside their functional contexts.},

	abstract = {Neuropeptides released by hypothalamic neurons play a major role in the regulation of feeding, acting both within the hypothalamus, and at other appetite regulating centres throughout the brain. Where classical neurotransmitters signal only within synapses, neuropeptides diffuse over greater distances affecting both nearby and distant neurons expressing the relevant receptors, which are often extrasynaptic. As well as triggering a behavioural output, neuropeptides also act as neuromodulators: altering the response of neurons to both neurotransmitters and circulating signals of nutrient status. The mechanisms of action of hypothalamic neuropeptides with established roles in feeding, including melanin-concentrating hormone ({MCH}), the orexins, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-{MSH}), agouti-gene related protein ({AgRP}), neuropeptide Y, and oxytocin, are reviewed in this article, with emphasis laid on both their effects on appetite regulating centres throughout the brain, and on examining the evidence for their physiological roles. In addition, evidence for the involvement of several putative appetite regulating hypothalamic neuropeptides is assessed including, ghrelin, cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript ({CART}), neuropeptide W and the galanin-like peptides.

In orthotopic nude-mouse models, breast cancer cells secreted exosomes into the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-derived exosomes were incorporated into tumor-associated cells as well as circulating in the blood of mice with breast cancer metastases.

Estrogen exerts its effects on healing via numerous cell types by signalling through the receptors {ERα} and {ERβ}, which bind to the Estrogen Responsive Element ({ERE}) and initiate gene transcription. The {ERE}-luciferase transgenic mouse model has been influential in assessing real-time in vivo estrogen receptor activation across a range of tissues and pathologies. Using this model we demonstrate novel temporally regulated peri-wound activation of estrogen signalling in female mice. Using histological methods we reveal that this signal is specifically localised to keratinocytes of the neoepidermis and wound margin dermal cells. Moreover using pharmacological agonists we reveal that {ERβ} induces {ERE}-mediated signal in both epidermal and dermal cells while {ERα} induces {ERE}-mediated signal in dermal cells alone. Collectively these novel data demonstrate rapid and regional activation of estrogen signalling in wounded skin. A more complete understanding of local hormonal signalling during repair is essential for the focussed development of new therapies for wound healing.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis ({MCIA}), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, {MCIA} simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using {MCIA}, applied to two typical "omics" research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the {NCI}-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation {RNA}-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of {RNA}-sequencing data processed using {RPKM} had greater variance than that with {MapSplice} and {RSEM}. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. {MCIA} is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor "omicade4" package.
{CONCLUSION}: We believe {MCIA} is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. {MCIA} provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer arising at a young age is relatively uncommon, particularly in the developed world. Several studies have demonstrated that younger patients often experience a more aggressive disease course and have poorer outcome compared to older women. Expression of key biomarkers, including endocrine receptors, {HER}2 and proliferation markers, appears to be different in younger patients and young women are more likely to harbor a genetic predisposition. Despite these differences, little research to date has focused on the biology of these tumors to refine prognosis, and potentially direct treatment strategies, which remain similar to those offered to older patients. Accumulating evidence suggests the differences in breast stroma in younger patients and changes that occur with pregnancy and breastfeeding likely contribute to the different biology of these tumors. Reproductive behaviors appear to impact the biology of tumors developing later in life. In addition, tumors arising during or shortly following pregnancy appear to exhibit unique biological features. In this review, we discuss our emerging understanding of the biology of breast cancer arising at a young age at both the pathologic and the genomic level. We elucidate the potential role of genomic signatures, the impact of pregnancy and breastfeeding on breast cancer biology, and how even current knowledge might advance the clinical management of young breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Rapid development of {DNA} microarray technology has resulted in different laboratories adopting numerous different protocols and technological platforms, which has severely impacted on the comparability of array data. Current cross-platform comparison of microarray gene expression data are usually based on cross-referencing the annotation of each gene transcript represented on the arrays, extracting a list of genes common to all arrays and comparing expression data of this gene subset. Unfortunately, filtering of genes to a subset represented across all arrays often excludes many thousands of genes, because different subsets of genes from the genome are represented on different arrays. We wish to describe the application of a powerful yet simple method for cross-platform comparison of gene expression data. Co-inertia analysis ({CIA}) is a multivariate method that identifies trends or co-relationships in multiple datasets which contain the same samples. {CIA} simultaneously finds ordinations (dimension reduction diagrams) from the datasets that are most similar. It does this by finding successive axes from the two datasets with maximum covariance. {CIA} can be applied to datasets where the number of variables (genes) far exceeds the number of samples (arrays) such is the case with microarray analyses. {RESULTS}: We illustrate the power of {CIA} for cross-platform analysis of gene expression data by using it to identify the main common relationships in expression profiles on a panel of 60 tumour cell lines from the National Cancer Institute ({NCI}) which have been subjected to microarray studies using both Affymetrix and spotted {cDNA} array technology. The co-ordinates of the {CIA} projections of the cell lines from each dataset are graphed in a bi-plot and are connected by a line, the length of which indicates the divergence between the two datasets. Thus, {CIA} provides graphical representation of consensus and divergence between the gene expression profiles from different microarray platforms. Secondly, the genes that define the main trends in the analysis can be easily identified. {CONCLUSIONS}: {CIA} is a robust, efficient approach to coupling of gene expression datasets. {CIA} provides simple graphical representations of the results making it a particularly attractive method for the identification of relationships between large datasets.},

We wanted to investigate a possible association between {HRT} use and the risk of a histologic subtype of breast cancer. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: From 1995 until 2004, 497 cases of primary ductal, lobular or ductulolobular breast cancer in postmenopausal women were diagnosed at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The data was derived from patient's records. {HRT} ever use was defined as {HRT} use for {\textgreater} or =6 months. {RESULTS}: Of the 99 cases of lobular cancer 72.7\% were invasive lobular cancers, 21.2\% were invasive ductulolobular cancers and 6.1\% were lobular cancers in situ. Of the 398 cases of ductal cancer, 90.5\% were invasive ductal cancers and 9.5\% were ductal cancers in situ. Totally 144 women were {HRT} ever users, and 341 women were {HRT} never users. {HRT} status could not be defined in 12 women. {HRT} ever use was associated with an increased risk for lobular cancer ({OR} 1.67; 95\% {CI} 1.02-2.73). Also, menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy was associated with an increased risk for lobular cancer ({OR} 2.42; 95\% {CI} 1.06-5.54). {CONCLUSIONS}: There is evidence that {HRT} as well as menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy may be associated with an increased risk for lobular cancer. This association is of major clinical relevance, since lobular breast cancer is more difficult to diagnose clinically and radiologically than ductal breast cancer.},

Defects in homologous recombination repair ({HRR}) are associated with genomic instability in {HGSC}, and are exploited by therapy targeting {DNA} repair. Defective {HRR} causes uniparental deletions and loss of heterozygosity ({LOH}). Our purpose is to profile {LOH} in {HGSC} and correlate our findings to clinical outcome, and compare {HGSC} and high-grade breast cancers.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: We examined {LOH} and copy number changes using single nucleotide polymorphism array data from three {HGSC} cohorts and compared results to a cohort of high-grade breast cancers. The {LOH} profiles in {HGSC} were matched to chemotherapy resistance and progression-free survival ({PFS}).
{RESULTS}: {LOH}-based clustering divided {HGSC} into two clusters. The major group displayed extensive {LOH} and was further divided into two subgroups. The second group contained remarkably less {LOH}. {BRCA}1 promoter methylation was associated with the major group. {LOH} clusters were reproducible when validated in two independent {HGSC} datasets. {LOH} burden in the major cluster of {HGSC} was similar to triple-negative, and distinct from other high-grade breast cancers. Our analysis revealed an {LOH} cluster with lower treatment resistance and a significant correlation between {LOH} burden and {PFS}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Separating {HGSC} by {LOH}-based clustering produces remarkably stable subgroups in three different cohorts. Patients in the various {LOH} clusters differed with respect to chemotherapy resistance, and the extent of {LOH} correlated with {PFS}. {LOH} burden may indicate vulnerability to treatment targeting {DNA} repair, such as {PARP}1 inhibitors.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Gene-set analysis evaluates the expression of biological pathways, or a priori defined gene sets, rather than that of individual genes, in association with a binary phenotype, and is of great biologic interest in many {DNA} microarray studies. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA}) has been applied widely as a tool for gene-set analyses. We describe here some critical problems with {GSEA} and propose an alternative method by extending the individual-gene analysis method, Significance Analysis of Microarray ({SAM}), to gene-set analyses ({SAM}-{GS}).


{RESULTS}

Using a mouse microarray dataset with simulated gene sets, we illustrate that {GSEA} gives statistical significance to gene sets that have no gene associated with the phenotype (null gene sets), and has very low power to detect gene sets in which half the genes are moderately or strongly associated with the phenotype (truly-associated gene sets). {SAM}-{GS}, on the other hand, performs very well. The two methods are also compared in the analyses of three real microarray datasets and relevant pathways, the diverging results of which clearly show advantages of {SAM}-{GS} over {GSEA}, both statistically and biologically. In a microarray study for identifying biological pathways whose gene expressions are associated with p53 mutation in cancer cell lines, we found biologically relevant performance differences between the two methods. Specifically, there are 31 additional pathways identified as significant by {SAM}-{GS} over {GSEA}, that are associated with the presence vs. absence of p53. Of the 31 gene sets, 11 actually involve p53 directly as a member. A further 6 gene sets directly involve the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, 3 involve the cell-cycle machinery, and 3 involve cytokines and/or {JAK}/{STAT} signaling. Each of these 12 gene sets, then, is in a direct, well-established relationship with aspects of p53 signaling. Of the remaining 8 gene sets, 6 have plausible, if less well established, links with p53.


{CONCLUSION}

We conclude that {GSEA} has important limitations as a gene-set analysis approach for microarray experiments for identifying biological pathways associated with a binary phenotype. As an alternative statistically-sound method, we propose {SAM}-{GS}. A free Excel Add-In for performing {SAM}-{GS} is available for public use.},

	abstract = {The number of high-dimensional datasets recording multiple aspects of a single phenomenon is increasing in many areas of science, accompanied by a need for mathematical frameworks that can compare multiple large-scale matrices with different row dimensions. The only such framework to date, the generalized singular value decomposition ({GSVD}), is limited to two matrices. We mathematically define a higher-order {GSVD} ({HO} {GSVD}) for N≥2 matrices , each with full column rank. Each matrix is exactly factored as Di = {UiΣiVT}, where V, identical in all factorizations, is obtained from the eigensystem {SV} = {VΛ} of the arithmetic mean S of all pairwise quotients of the matrices , i≠j. We prove that this decomposition extends to higher orders almost all of the mathematical properties of the {GSVD}. The matrix S is nondefective with V and Λ real. Its eigenvalues satisfy λk≥1. Equality holds if and only if the corresponding eigenvector vk is a right basis vector of equal significance in all matrices Di and Dj, that is σi,k/σj,k = 1 for all i and j, and the corresponding left basis vector ui,k is orthogonal to all other vectors in Ui for all i. The eigenvalues λk = 1, therefore, define the “common {HO} {GSVD} subspace.” We illustrate the {HO} {GSVD} with a comparison of genome-scale cell-cycle {mRNA} expression from S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and human. Unlike existing algorithms, a mapping among the genes of these disparate organisms is not required. We find that the approximately common {HO} {GSVD} subspace represents the cell-cycle {mRNA} expression oscillations, which are similar among the datasets. Simultaneous reconstruction in the common subspace, therefore, removes the experimental artifacts, which are dissimilar, from the datasets. In the simultaneous sequence-independent classification of the genes of the three organisms in this common subspace, genes of highly conserved sequences but significantly different cell-cycle peak times are correctly classified.},

	abstract = {Polo-like kinases ({PLKs}) play an important role in cell cycle progression, checkpoint control and mitosis. The high mitotic index and chromosomal instability of advanced cancers suggest that {PLK} inhibitors may be an attractive therapeutic option for presently incurable advanced neoplasias with systemic involvement, such as multiple myeloma ({MM}). We studied the {PLK} 1, 2, 3 inhibitor {BI} 2536 and observed potent ({IC}50{\textless}40 {nM}) and rapid (commitment to cell death {\textless}24 hrs) in vitro activity against {MM} cells in isolation, as well as in vivo activity against a traditional subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Tumor cells in {MM} patients, however, don't exist in isolation, but reside in and interact with the bone microenvironment. Therefore conventional in vitro and in vivo preclinical assays don't take into account how interactions between {MM} cells and the bone microenvironment can potentially confer drug resistance. To probe this question, we performed tumor cell compartment-specific bioluminescence imaging assays to compare the preclinical anti-{MM} activity of {BI} 2536 in vitro in the presence vs. absence of stromal cells or osteoclasts. We observed that the presence of these bone marrow non-malignant cells led to decreased anti-{MM} activity of {BI} 2536. We further validated these results in an orthotopic in vivo mouse model of diffuse {MM} bone lesions where tumor cells interact with non-malignant cells of the bone microenvironment. We again observed that {BI} 2536 had decreased activity in this in vivo model of tumor-bone microenvironment interactions highlighting that, despite {BI} 2536's promising activity in conventional assays, its lack of activity in microenvironmental models raises concerns for its clinical development for {MM}. More broadly, preclinical drug testing in the absence of relevant tumor microenvironment interactions may overestimate potential clinical activity, thus explaining at least in part the gap between preclinical vs. clinical efficacy in {MM} and other cancers.},

Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations ({CNAs}) were associated with expression in ∼40\% of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting {CNAs}. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by {CNAs}, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in {PPP}2R2A, {MTAP} and {MAP}2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired {DNA}-{RNA} profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of {CNAs}. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a {TCR} deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the '{CNA}-devoid' subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic {CNAs} on the transcriptome.},

Although the exact phenotype of the malignant cells responsible for metastasis and dormancy is still unknown, growing evidence has revealed that they may have stem cell-like properties that may account for resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. One process that has been attributed to primary tumor metastasis is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In this review, we specifically discuss breast cancer dissemination to the bone marrow and factors that ultimately serve to shelter and promote tumor growth, including the complex relationship between mesenchymal stem cells ({MSCs}) and various aspects of the immune system, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, and the diverse components of the tumor microenvironment.

Targeting was achieved by engineering the donor cells to express the transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor receptor fused to the {GE}11 peptide. Intravenously injected exosomes delivered let-7a {miRNA} to {EGFR}-expressing xenograft breast cancer tissue in {RAG}2(-/-) mice.

Tumor genome analysis has revealed extreme heterogeneity among tumor missense mutation profiles, but their relevance to tumor immunology and patient outcomes has awaited comprehensive evaluation. Here, for 515 patients from six tumor sites, we used {RNA}-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify mutations that are predicted to be immunogenic in that they yielded mutational epitopes presented by the {MHC} proteins encoded by each patient’s autologous {HLA}-A alleles. Mutational epitopes were associated with increased patient survival. Moreover, the corresponding tumors had higher {CTL} content, inferred from {CD}8A gene expression, and elevated expression of the {CTL} exhaustion markers {PDCD}1 and {CTLA}4. Mutational epitopes were very scarce in tumors without evidence of {CTL} infiltration. These findings suggest that the abundance of predicted immunogenic mutations may be useful for identifying patients likely to benefit from checkpoint blockade and related immunotherapies.},

	abstract = {The association between large tumor size and metastatic risk in a majority of clinical cancers has led to questions as to whether these observations are causally related or whether one is simply a marker for the other. This is partly due to an uncertainty about how metastasis-promoting gene expression changes can arise in primary tumors. We investigated this question through the analysis of a previously defined "lung metastasis gene-expression signature" ({LMS}) that mediates experimental breast cancer metastasis selectively to the lung and is expressed by primary human breast cancer with a high risk for developing lung metastasis. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the {LMS} promotes primary tumor growth that enriches for {LMS}(+) cells, and it allows for intravasation after reaching a critical tumor size. Clinically, this corresponds to {LMS}(+) tumors being larger at diagnosis compared with {LMS}(-) tumors and to a marked rise in the incidence of metastasis after {LMS}(+) tumors reach 2 cm. Patients with {LMS}-expressing primary tumors selectively fail in the lung compared with the bone or other visceral sites and have a worse overall survival. The mechanistic linkage between metastasis gene expression, accelerated tumor growth, and likelihood of metastatic recurrence provided by the {LMS} may help to explain observations of prognostic gene signatures in primary cancer and how tumor growth can both lead to metastasis and be a marker for cells destined to metastasize.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The molecular complexity of a tumor manifests itself at the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Genomic profiling at these multiple levels should allow an integrated characterization of tumor etiology. However, there is a shortage of effective statistical and bioinformatic tools for truly integrative data analysis. The standard approach to integrative clustering is separate clustering followed by manual integration. A more statistically powerful approach would incorporate all data types simultaneously and generate a single integrated cluster assignment.
{METHODS}: We developed a joint latent variable model for integrative clustering. We call the resulting methodology {iCluster}. {iCluster} incorporates flexible modeling of the associations between different data types and the variance-covariance structure within data types in a single framework, while simultaneously reducing the dimensionality of the datasets. Likelihood-based inference is obtained through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
{RESULTS}: We demonstrate the {iCluster} algorithm using two examples of joint analysis of copy number and gene expression data, one from breast cancer and one from lung cancer. In both cases, we identified subtypes characterized by concordant {DNA} copy number changes and gene expression as well as unique profiles specific to one or the other in a completely automated fashion. In addition, the algorithm discovers potentially novel subtypes by combining weak yet consistent alteration patterns across data types.

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that human genomic variations are associated with an individual’s susceptibility to complex diseases such as cancers and autoimmune diseases. However, extensive genome-wide association studies thus far had limited success because the results have low predictive value of practical utility to individuals. We present a prediction process where two machine-learning analysis methods are applied to two different descriptors of each individual’s common genomic variations to predict an individual’s susceptibility to eight major cancer traits. The accuracy of the prediction ranges from 33\% to 57\% depending on cancer type, which is significantly better than 11\% for a random prediction, with probability estimates that may be useful for making practical health decisions for individuals or for a population., An empirical approach is presented for predicting the genomic susceptibility of an individual to the most likely one among nine traits, consisting of eight major cancer classes plus a healthy trait. We use four prediction methods by applying two supervised learning algorithms to two different descriptors of common genomic variations (the profiles of genotypes of {SNPs} and {SNP} syntaxes with low P values or low frequencies) of each individual genome from normal cells. All four methods made correct predictions substantially better than random predictions for most cancer classes, but not for some others. A combination of the four results using Bayesian inference better predicted overall than any individual method. The multiclass accuracy of the combined prediction ranges from 33\% to 56\% depending on cancer classes of testing sets, compared with 11\% for a random prediction among nine traits. Despite limited {SNP} data available and the absence of rare {SNPs} in public databases, at present, the results suggest that the framework of this approach or its improvement can predict cancer susceptibility with probability estimates useful for making health decisions for individuals or for a population.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors result in impressive clinical responses, but optimal results will require combination with each other and other therapies. This raises fundamental questions about mechanisms of non-redundancy and resistance. Here we report major tumour regressions in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with an anti-{CTLA}4 antibody (anti-{CTLA}4) and radiation, and reproduced this effect in mouse models. Although combined treatment improved responses in irradiated and unirradiated tumours, resistance was common. Unbiased analyses of mice revealed that resistance was due to upregulation of {PD}-L1 on melanoma cells and associated with T-cell exhaustion. Accordingly, optimal response in melanoma and other cancer types requires radiation, anti-{CTLA}4 and anti-{PD}-L1/{PD}-1. Anti-{CTLA}4 predominantly inhibits T-regulatory cells (Treg cells), thereby increasing the {CD}8 T-cell to Treg ({CD}8/Treg) ratio. Radiation enhances the diversity of the T-cell receptor ({TCR}) repertoire of intratumoral T cells. Together, anti-{CTLA}4 promotes expansion of T cells, while radiation shapes the {TCR} repertoire of the expanded peripheral clones. Addition of {PD}-L1 blockade reverses T-cell exhaustion to mitigate depression in the {CD}8/Treg ratio and further encourages oligoclonal T-cell expansion. Similarly to results from mice, patients on our clinical trial with melanoma showing high {PD}-L1 did not respond to radiation plus anti-{CTLA}4, demonstrated persistent T-cell exhaustion, and rapidly progressed. Thus, {PD}-L1 on melanoma cells allows tumours to escape anti-{CTLA}4-based therapy, and the combination of radiation, anti-{CTLA}4 and anti-{PD}-L1 promotes response and immunity through distinct mechanisms.},

	abstract = {There have been no major advances for the treatment of metastatic urothelial bladder cancer ({UBC}) in the last 30 years. Chemotherapy is still the standard of care. Patient outcomes, especially for those in whom chemotherapy is not effective or is poorly tolerated, remain poor. One hallmark of {UBC} is the presence of high rates of somatic mutations. These alterations may enhance the ability of the host immune system to recognize tumour cells as foreign owing to an increased number of antigens. However, these cancers may also elude immune surveillance and eradication through the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 ({PD}-L1; also called {CD}274 or B7-H1) in the tumour microenvironment. Therefore, we examined the anti-{PD}-L1 antibody {MPDL}3280A, a systemic cancer immunotherapy, for the treatment of metastatic {UBC}. {MPDL}3280A is a high-affinity engineered human anti-{PD}-L1 monoclonal immunoglobulin-G1 antibody that inhibits the interaction of {PD}-L1 with {PD}-1 ({PDCD}1) and B7.1 ({CD}80). Because {PD}-L1 is expressed on activated T cells, {MPDL}3280A was engineered with a modification in the Fc domain that eliminates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at clinically relevant doses to prevent the depletion of T cells expressing {PD}-L1. Here we show that {MPDL}3280A has noteworthy activity in metastatic {UBC}. Responses were often rapid, with many occurring at the time of the first response assessment (6 weeks) and nearly all were ongoing at the data cutoff. This phase I expansion study, with an adaptive design that allowed for biomarker-positive enriched cohorts, demonstrated that tumours expressing {PD}-L1-positive tumour-infiltrating immune cells had particularly high response rates. Moreover, owing to the favourable toxicity profile, including a lack of renal toxicity, patients with {UBC}, who are often older and have a higher incidence of renal impairment, may be better able to tolerate {MPDL}3280A versus chemotherapy. These results suggest that {MPDL}3280A may have an important role in treating {UBC}—the drug received breakthrough designation status by the {US} Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) in June 2014.},

However, responses to targeted anti-angiogenic therapies have been reported to vary among patients. This suggests that the tumor vasculature may be heterogeneous and that an appropriate choice of treatment would require an understanding of these differences. {METHODS}: In order to investigate whether and how the breast tumor vasculature varies between individuals, we have isolated tumor-associated and matched normal vasculature from 17 breast carcinomas by laser capture microdissection, and generated gene expression profiles. Since microvessel density has previously been associated with disease course, tumors with low (n=9) or high (n=8) microvessel density were selected for analysis to maximize heterogeneity for this feature. {RESULTS}: We identify differences between tumor and normal vasculature, and describe two subtypes present within tumor vasculature. These subtypes exhibit distinct gene expression signatures that reflect features including hallmarks of vessel maturity. Potential therapeutic targets ({MET}, {ITGAV} and {PDGFR}) are differentially expressed between subtypes. Taking these subtypes into account has allowed us to derive a vascular signature associated with disease outcome. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results further support a role for tumor microvasculature in determining disease progression. Overall, this study provides a deeper molecular understanding of the heterogeneity existing within the breast tumor vasculature, and opens new avenues towards the improved design and targeting of anti-angiogenic therapies.},

	abstract = {Most invasive breast cancers are classified as invasive ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified ({IDC} {NOS}), whereas about 25\% are defined as histological 'special types'. These special-type breast cancers are categorized into at least 17 discrete pathological entities; however, whether these also constitute discrete molecular entities remains to be determined. Current therapy decision-making is increasingly governed by the molecular classification of breast cancer (luminal, basal-like, {HER}2+). The molecular classification is derived from mainly {IDC} {NOS} and it is unknown whether this classification applies to all histological subtypes. We aimed to refine the breast cancer classification systems by analysing a series of 11 histological special types [invasive lobular carcinoma ({ILC}), tubular, mucinous A, mucinous B, neuroendocrine, apocrine, {IDC} with osteoclastic giant cells, micropapillary, adenoid cystic, metaplastic, and medullary carcinoma] using immunohistochemistry and genome-wide gene expression profiling. Hierarchical clustering analysis confirmed that some histological special types constitute discrete entities, such as micropapillary carcinoma, but also revealed that others, including tubular and lobular carcinoma, are very similar at the transcriptome level. When classified by expression profiling, {IDC} {NOS} and {ILC} contain all molecular breast cancer types (ie luminal, basal-like, {HER}2+), whereas histological special-type cancers, apart from apocrine carcinoma, are homogeneous and only belong to one molecular subtype. Our analysis also revealed that some special types associated with a good prognosis, such as medullary and adenoid cystic carcinomas, display a poor prognosis basal-like transcriptome, providing strong circumstantial evidence that basal-like cancers constitute a heterogeneous group. Taken together, our results imply that the correct classification of breast cancers of special histological type will allow a more accurate prognostication of breast cancer patients and facilitate the identification of optimal therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Basal-like and Luminal breast cancers have distinct stromal-epithelial interactions, which play a role in progression to invasive cancer. However, little is known about how stromal-epithelial interactions evolve in benign and pre-invasive lesions.
{METHODS}: To study epithelial-stroma interactions in Basal-like breast cancer progression, we cocultured reduction mammoplasty fibroblasts ({RMFs}) with the isogenic {MCF}10 series of cell lines (representing benign/normal, atypical hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ). We used gene expression microarrays to identify pathways induced by coculture in premalignant cells ({MCF}10DCIS) compared to normal and benign ({MCF}10A and {MCF}10AT1). Relevant pathways were then (1) evaluated in vivo for associations with Basal-like subtype and (2) targeted in vitro to evaluate effects on morphogenesis.
{RESULTS}: Our results show that premalignant {MCF}10DCIS cells express characteristic gene expression patterns of invasive Basal-like microenvironments. Furthermore, while hepatocyte growth factor ({HGF}) secretion is upregulated (relative to normal, {MCF}10A levels) when fibroblasts are cocultured with either atypical ({MCF}10AT1 cells) or premalignant ({MCF}10DCIS) cells, only {MCF}10DCIS cells upregulate the {HGF} receptor, {MET}. In 3-dimensional cultures, upregulation of {HGF}/{MET} in {MCF}10DCIS cells induced morphological changes suggestive of invasive potential, and these changes were reversed by antibody-based blocking of {HGF} signaling. These results are relevant to in vivo progression because high expression of a novel {MCF}10DCIS-derived {HGF} signature was correlated with Basal-like subtype, with approximately 86\% of Basal-like cancers highly expressing the {HGF} signature, and because high expression of {HGF} signature was associated with poor survival.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Coordinated and complementary changes in {HGF}/{MET} expression occur in epithelium and stroma during progression of pre-invasive basal-like lesions. These results suggest that targeting stroma-derived {HGF} signaling in early carcinogenesis may block progression of Basal-like precursor lesions.},

Invasive breast cancers in germline {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 mutation carriers have a distinct "basal" and "luminal" immunophenotype, respectively, but the immunophenotype of their precursor lesions has hardly been studied, and this was the aim of this study. {METHODS} {DCIS} lesions of 25 proven {BRCA}1 and 9 proven {BRCA}2 germline mutation carriers and their 22 and 6, respectively, accompanying invasive lesions were stained by immunohistochemistry for oestrogen receptor ({ER}), progesterone receptor ({PR}), human epidermal growth factor receptor ({HER})2/neu, cytokeratin ({CK})5/6, {CK}14, epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) and Ki67. {RESULTS} {DCIS} lesions in {BRCA}1 mutation carriers were mostly of the basal molecular type with low {ER}/{PR}/{HER}2 expression, while they frequently expressed {CK}5/6, {CK}14 and {EGFR}, and were mostly grade 3 and highly proliferative. {DCIS} lesions in {BRCA}2 mutation carriers were mostly of luminal molecular type with frequent expression of {ER}/{PR}, and infrequent expression of {CK}5/6, {CK}14 and {EGFR}, and they were mostly grade 3 and showed low proliferation. In {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 mutation carriers there was a high concordance between {DCIS} lesions and their concomitant invasive counterpart with regard to expression of individual markers as well as "molecular" subtype. {CONCLUSIONS} Although the number of cases studied was low, {DCIS} lesions in {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 mutations carriers are usually of the basal and luminal molecular type, respectively, similar to their accompanying invasive cancers, thereby providing evidence that {DCIS} is a direct precursor lesion in these hereditary predisposed patients. This also suggests that crucial carcinogenetic events leading to these phenotypes in hereditary predisposed patients occur before the stage of invasion.},

	abstract = {A new multivariate analysis technique, developed to relate community composition to known variation in the environment, is described. The technique is an extension of correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging), a popular ordination technique that extracts continuous axes of variation from species occurrence or abundance data. Such ordination axes are typically interpreted with the help of external knowledge and data on environmental variables; this two-step approach (ordination followed by environmental gradient identification) is termed indirect gradient analysis. In the new technique, called canonical correspondence analysis, ordination axes are chosen in the light of known environmental variables by imposing the extra restriction that the axes be linear combinations of environmental variables. In this way community variation can be directly related to environmental variation. The environmental variables may be quantitative or nominal. As many axes can be extracted as there are environmental variables. The method of detrending can be incorporated in the technique to remove arch effects. (Detrended) canonical correspondence analysis is an efficient ordination technique when species have bell-shaped response curves or surfaces with respect to environmental gradients, and is therefore more appropriate for analyzing data on community composition and environmental variables than canonical correlation analysis. The new technique leads to an ordination diagram in which points represent species and sites, and vectors represent environmental variables. Such a diagram shows the patterns of variation in community composition that can be explained best by the environmental variables and also visualizes approximately the @'centers@' of the species distributions along each of the environmental variables. Such diagrams effectively summarized relationships between community and environment for data sets on hunting spiders, dyke vegetation, and algae along a pollution gradient.},

	abstract = {Modern high-throughput methods allow the investigation of biological functions across multiple ‘omics’ levels. Levels include {mRNA} and protein expression profiling as well as additional knowledge on, for example, {DNA} methylation and {microRNA} regulation. The reason for this interest in multi-omics is that actual cellular responses to different conditions are best explained mechanistically when taking all omics levels into account. To map gene products to their biological functions, public ontologies like Gene Ontology are commonly used. Many methods have been developed to identify terms in an ontology, overrepresented within a set of genes. However, these methods are not able to appropriately deal with any combination of several data types. Here, we propose a new method to analyse integrated data across multiple omics-levels to simultaneously assess their biological meaning. We developed a model-based Bayesian method for inferring interpretable term probabilities in a modular framework. Our Multi-level {ONtology} Analysis ({MONA}) algorithm performed significantly better than conventional analyses of individual levels and yields best results even for sophisticated models including {mRNA} fine-tuning by {microRNAs}. The {MONA} framework is flexible enough to allow for different underlying regulatory motifs or ontologies.

Whereas {IDC} incidence has remained stable, {ILC} is the most rapidly increasing breast cancer phenotype in the United States and Western Europe. It is not clear whether {IDC} and {ILC} represent molecularly distinct entities and what genes might be involved in the development of these two phenotypes. We conducted comprehensive gene expression profiling studies to address these questions. Total {RNA} from 21 {ILCs}, 38 {IDCs}, two lymph node metastases, and three normal tissues were amplified and hybridized to approximately 42,000 clone {cDNA} microarrays. Data were analyzed using hierarchical clustering algorithms and statistical analyses that identify differentially expressed genes (significance analysis of microarrays) and minimal subsets of genes (prediction analysis for microarrays) that succinctly distinguish {ILCs} and {IDCs}. Eleven of 21 (52\%) of the {ILCs} ("typical" {ILCs}) clustered together and displayed different gene expression profiles from {IDCs}, whereas the other {ILCs} ("ductal-like" {ILCs}) were distributed between different {IDC} subtypes. Many of the differentially expressed genes between {ILCs} and {IDCs} code for proteins involved in cell adhesion/motility, lipid/fatty acid transport and metabolism, immune/defense response, and electron transport. Many genes that distinguish typical and ductal-like {ILCs} are involved in regulation of cell growth and immune response. Our data strongly suggest that over half the {ILCs} differ from {IDCs} not only in histological and clinical features but also in global transcription programs. The remaining {ILCs} closely resemble {IDCs} in their transcription patterns. Further studies are needed to explore the differences between {ILC} molecular subtypes and to determine whether they require different therapeutic strategies.},

We evaluated whether combining the prognostic powers of standard breast cancer clinical variables with a large set of gene expression signatures could improve on our ability to predict patient outcomes. {METHODS} Using clinical-pathological variables and a collection of 323 gene expression "modules", including 115 previously published signatures, we build multivariate Cox proportional hazards models using a dataset of 550 node-negative systemically untreated breast cancer patients. Models predictive of pathological complete response ({pCR}) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were also built using this approach. {RESULTS} We identified statistically significant prognostic models for relapse-free survival ({RFS}) at 7 years for the entire population, and for the subgroups of patients with {ER}-positive, or Luminal tumors. Furthermore, we found that combined models that included both clinical and genomic parameters improved prognostication compared with models with either clinical or genomic variables alone. Finally, we were able to build statistically significant combined models for pathological complete response ({pCR}) predictions for the entire population. {CONCLUSIONS} Integration of gene expression signatures and clinical-pathological factors is an improved method over either variable type alone. Highly prognostic models could be created when using all patients, and for the subset of patients with lymph node-negative and {ER}-positive breast cancers. Other variables beyond gene expression and clinical-pathological variables, like gene mutation status or {DNA} copy number changes, will be needed to build robust prognostic models for {ER}-negative breast cancer patients. This combined clinical and genomics model approach can also be used to build predictors of therapy responsiveness, and could ultimately be applied to other tumor types.},

Many computational predictions for new indications have been borne out in cellular model systems, though extensive animal model and clinical trial-based validation are still pending. In this review, we show that computational methods for drug repositioning can be classified in two axes: drug based, where discovery initiates from the chemical perspective, or disease based, where discovery initiates from the clinical perspective of disease or its pathology. Newer algorithms for computational drug repositioning will likely span these two axes, will take advantage of newer types of molecular measurements, and will certainly play a role in reducing the global burden of disease.},

	abstract = {The number of high-dimensional datasets recording multiple aspects of a single phenomenon is increasing in many areas of science, accompanied by a need for mathematical frameworks that can compare multiple large-scale matrices with different row dimensions. The only such framework to date, the generalized singular value decomposition ({GSVD}), is limited to two matrices. We mathematically define a higher-order {GSVD} ({HO} {GSVD}) for N≥2 matrices D(i)∈R(m(i) × n), each with full column rank. Each matrix is exactly factored as D(i)=U(i)Σ(i)V(T), where V, identical in all factorizations, is obtained from the eigensystem {SV}={VΛ} of the arithmetic mean S of all pairwise quotients A(i)A(j)(-1) of the matrices A(i)=D(i)(T)D(i), i≠j. We prove that this decomposition extends to higher orders almost all of the mathematical properties of the {GSVD}. The matrix S is nondefective with V and Λ real. Its eigenvalues satisfy λ(k)≥1. Equality holds if and only if the corresponding eigenvector v(k) is a right basis vector of equal significance in all matrices D(i) and D(j), that is σ(i,k)/σ(j,k)=1 for all i and j, and the corresponding left basis vector u(i,k) is orthogonal to all other vectors in U(i) for all i. The eigenvalues λ(k)=1, therefore, define the "common {HO} {GSVD} subspace." We illustrate the {HO} {GSVD} with a comparison of genome-scale cell-cycle {mRNA} expression from S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and human. Unlike existing algorithms, a mapping among the genes of these disparate organisms is not required. We find that the approximately common {HO} {GSVD} subspace represents the cell-cycle {mRNA} expression oscillations, which are similar among the datasets. Simultaneous reconstruction in the common subspace, therefore, removes the experimental artifacts, which are dissimilar, from the datasets. In the simultaneous sequence-independent classification of the genes of the three organisms in this common subspace, genes of highly conserved sequences but significantly different cell-cycle peak times are correctly classified.},

Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from fresh and frozen human serum and saliva. The amount of selected {miRNAs} extracted from the exosomal pellet and the exosome-depleted serum and saliva was compared by quantitative {RT}-{PCR}. Some {miRNAs} tested are ubiquitously expressed, others were previously reported as biomarkers. We included {miRNAs} previously reported to be free circulating and some thought to be exosome specific. The purity of exosome fraction was confirmed by electronmicroscopy and western blot. The concentration of {miRNAs} was consistently higher in the exosome pellet compared to the exosome-depleted supernatant. We obtained the same results using an equal volume or equal amount of total {RNA} as input of the {RT}-{qPCR}. The concentration of {miRNA} in whole, unfractionated serum, was between the exosomal pellet and the exosome-depleted supernatant. Selected {miRNAs}, which were detectable in exosomes, were undetectable in whole serum and the exosome-depleted supernantant. Exosome isolation improves the sensitivity of {miRNA} amplification from human biologic fluids.

	abstract = {The rapid accumulation of biological networks poses new challenges and calls for powerful integrative analysis tools. Most existing methods capable of simultaneously analyzing a large number of networks were primarily designed for unweighted networks, and cannot easily be extended to weighted networks. However, it is known that transforming weighted into unweighted networks by dichotomizing the edges of weighted networks with a threshold generally leads to information loss. We have developed a novel, tensor-based computational framework for mining recurrent heavy subgraphs in a large set of massive weighted networks. Specifically, we formulate the recurrent heavy subgraph identification problem as a heavy 3D subtensor discovery problem with sparse constraints. We describe an effective approach to solving this problem by designing a multi-stage, convex relaxation protocol, and a non-uniform edge sampling technique. We applied our method to 130 co-expression networks, and identified 11,394 recurrent heavy subgraphs, grouped into 2,810 families. We demonstrated that the identified subgraphs represent meaningful biological modules by validating against a large set of compiled biological knowledge bases. We also showed that the likelihood for a heavy subgraph to be meaningful increases significantly with its recurrence in multiple networks, highlighting the importance of the integrative approach to biological network analysis. Moreover, our approach based on weighted graphs detects many patterns that would be overlooked using unweighted graphs. In addition, we identified a large number of modules that occur predominately under specific phenotypes. This analysis resulted in a genome-wide mapping of gene network modules onto the phenome. Finally, by comparing module activities across many datasets, we discovered high-order dynamic cooperativeness in protein complex networks and transcriptional regulatory networks.},

We consider the complex structure of repeated measurements from different assays where different conditions are applied on the same subjects.
{RESULTS}: We propose a two-step analysis combining a multilevel approach and a multivariate approach to reveal separately the effects of conditions within subjects from the biological variation between subjects. The approach is extended to two-factor designs and to the integration of two matched data sets. It allows internal variable selection to highlight genes able to discriminate the net condition effect within subjects. A simulation study was performed to demonstrate the good performance of the multilevel multivariate approach compared to a classical multivariate method. The multilevel multivariate approach outperformed the classical multivariate approach with respect to the classification error rate and the selection of relevant genes. The approach was applied to an {HIV}-vaccine trial evaluating the response with gene expression and cytokine secretion. The discriminant multilevel analysis selected a relevant subset of genes while the integrative multilevel analysis highlighted clusters of genes and cytokines that were highly correlated across the samples.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our combined multilevel multivariate approach may help in finding signatures of vaccine effect and allows for a better understanding of immunological mechanisms activated by the intervention. The integrative analysis revealed clusters of genes, that were associated with cytokine secretion. These clusters can be seen as gene signatures to predict future cytokine response. The approach is implemented in the R package {mixOmics} (http://cran.r-project.org/) with associated tutorials to perform the analysis(a).},

Considerable progress has been made in recent years regarding how tumor cells circulating in the blood and lymphatic systems interact with and extravasate into secondary sites, and what determines whether these disseminated tumors cells survive, remain dormant or go on to form macrometastases. New insights into the routes that tumor cells take once leaving the primary tumor have emerged. Novel concepts regarding early seeding of metastases coupled to parallel progression, self-seeding of primary tumors by circulating tumor cells and the induction of premetastatic niches in distant organs by primary tumors have come to the fore. The perceived role of the lymphatic system in determining patterns of metastasis formation in distant organs has been reassessed. Together these new insights have the potential to offer new therapeutic options. In particular, the regulation of tumor cell dormancy emerges as a key event in metastasis formation, and therapeutic control of dormancy holds the promise of rendering cancer a chronic rather than life-threatening disease.},

Herein, we analyzed transcript profiles of 251 p53-sequenced primary breast tumors and identified a clinically embedded 32-gene expression signature that distinguishes p53-mutant and wild-type tumors of different histologies and outperforms sequence-based assessments of p53 in predicting prognosis and therapeutic response. Moreover, the p53 signature identified a subset of aggressive tumors absent of sequence mutations in p53 yet exhibiting expression characteristics consistent with p53 deficiency because of attenuated p53 transcript levels. Our results show the primary importance of p53 functional status in predicting clinical breast cancer behavior.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Multiple breast cancer gene expression profiles have been developed that appear to provide similar abilities to predict outcome and may outperform clinical-pathologic criteria; however, the extent to which seemingly disparate profiles provide additive prognostic information is not known, nor do we know whether prognostic profiles perform equally across clinically defined breast cancer subtypes. We evaluated whether combining the prognostic powers of standard breast cancer clinical variables with a large set of gene expression signatures could improve on our ability to predict patient outcomes.
{METHODS}: Using clinical-pathological variables and a collection of 323 gene expression "modules", including 115 previously published signatures, we build multivariate Cox proportional hazards models using a dataset of 550 node-negative systemically untreated breast cancer patients. Models predictive of pathological complete response ({pCR}) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were also built using this approach.
{RESULTS}: We identified statistically significant prognostic models for relapse-free survival ({RFS}) at 7 years for the entire population, and for the subgroups of patients with {ER}-positive, or Luminal tumors. Furthermore, we found that combined models that included both clinical and genomic parameters improved prognostication compared with models with either clinical or genomic variables alone. Finally, we were able to build statistically significant combined models for pathological complete response ({pCR}) predictions for the entire population.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Integration of gene expression signatures and clinical-pathological factors is an improved method over either variable type alone. Highly prognostic models could be created when using all patients, and for the subset of patients with lymph node-negative and {ER}-positive breast cancers. Other variables beyond gene expression and clinical-pathological variables, like gene mutation status or {DNA} copy number changes, will be needed to build robust prognostic models for {ER}-negative breast cancer patients. This combined clinical and genomics model approach can also be used to build predictors of therapy responsiveness, and could ultimately be applied to other tumor types.},

In spite to the wealth of information provided by functional profiling methods, a common limitation to all of them is their inherent unidimensional nature. In order to overcome this restriction we present a multidimensional logistic model that allows studying the relationship of gene modules with different genome-scale measurements (e.g. differential expression, genotyping association, methylation, copy number alterations, heterozygosity, etc.) simultaneously. Moreover, the relationship of such functional modules with the interactions among the variables can also be studied, which produces novel results impossible to be derived from the conventional unidimensional functional profiling methods. We report sound results of gene sets associations that remained undetected by the conventional one-dimensional gene set analysis in several examples.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}

Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65\%) and bronchopulmonary tract (25\%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides ({BLP}) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from carcinoids of intestinal origin.


{METHODS}

Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and determine {BLP} levels in these tumors.


{RESULTS}

All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes ({GRPR}, {NMBR}, and {BRS}-3) were present on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low {BLP} levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor ligand binding densities in combination with low {BLP} levels.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar {BLP} levels. The combined presence of bombesin and its receptors might suggest the presence of a paracrine or autocrine growth loop in carcinoids.},

In this article we demonstrate that both macrophage abundance and T-cell abundance in breast cancer represent prognostic indicators for recurrence-free and overall survival. We provide evidence that response to chemotherapy is in part regulated by these leukocytes; cytotoxic therapies induce mammary epithelial cells to produce monocyte/macrophage recruitment factors, including colony stimulating factor 1 ({CSF}1) and interleukin-34, which together enhance {CSF}1 receptor ({CSF}1R)-dependent macrophage infiltration. Blockade of macrophage recruitment with {CSF}1R-signaling antagonists, in combination with paclitaxel, improved survival of mammary tumor-bearing mice by slowing primary tumor development and reducing pulmonary metastasis. These improved aspects of mammary carcinogenesis were accompanied by decreased vessel density and appearance of antitumor immune programs fostering tumor suppression in a {CD}8+ T-cell-dependent manner. These data provide a rationale for targeting macrophage recruitment/response pathways, notably {CSF}1R, in combination with cytotoxic therapy, and identification of a breast cancer population likely to benefit from this novel therapeutic approach. {SIGNIFICANCE}: These findings reveal that response to chemotherapy is in part regulated by the tumor immune microenvironment and that common cytotoxic drugs induce neoplastic cells to produce monocyte/macrophage recruitment factors, which in turn enhance macrophage infiltration into mammary adenocarcinomas. Blockade of pathways mediating macrophage recruitment, in combination with chemotherapy, significantly decreases primary tumor progression, reduces metastasis, and improves survival by {CD}8+ T-cell-dependent mechanisms, thus indicating that the immune microenvironment of tumors can be reprogrammed to instead foster antitumor immunity and improve response to cytotoxic therapy.},

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the main cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Microvesicles ({MVs}) are fragments of the plasma membrane secreted from cytoplasmic membrane compartments by normal and malignant cells. An increase in {MV} number has been found in peripheral blood of patients with several diseases including cancer. We hypothesized that {MV} number and the relative amount of focal adhesion kinase ({FAK}) and epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}) proteins in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} are related to the presence of breast cancer.
Methods
Plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} were obtained by differential centrifugation of blood samples. {MV} number was evaluated by {BD} {TruCOUNT} Tubes ({BD} Biosciences). {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins were analyzed by Western blot.
Results
{MV} number in plasma fractions enriched with {MVs} and deprived of platelet-derived {MVs} is higher in breast cancer patients with stages I–{IV} as well as with T2–T4 tumors, in comparison to control group. In addition, plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} present {FAK} and {EGFR} proteins and their amount is increased in some stages of breast cancer in comparison to control group.
Conclusions
Our findings strongly suggest that {MV} number and the amount of {FAK} and {EGFR} in plasma fractions enriched in {MVs} are associated with some stages of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Exosome secretion is a notable feature of malignancy owing to the roles of these nanoparticles in cancer growth, immune suppression, tumor angiogenesis and therapeutic resistance. Exosomes are 30–100 nm membrane vesicles released by many cells types during normal physiological processes. Tumors aberrantly secrete large quantities of exosomes that transport oncoproteins and immune suppressive molecules to support tumor growth and metastasis. The role of exosomes in intercellular signaling is exemplified by human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 ({HER}2) over-expressing breast cancer, where exosomes with the {HER}2 oncoprotein stimulate tumor growth and interfere with the activity of the therapeutic antibody Herceptin®. Since numerous observations from experimental model systems point toward an important clinical impact of exosomes in cancer, several pharmacological strategies have been proposed for targeting their malignant activities. We also propose a novel device strategy involving extracorporeal hemofiltration of exosomes from the entire circulatory system using an affinity plasmapheresis platform known as the Aethlon {ADAPT}™ (adaptive dialysis-like affinity platform technology) system, which would overcome the risks of toxicity and drug interactions posed by pharmacological approaches. This technology allows affinity agents, including exosome-binding lectins and antibodies, to be immobilized in the outer-capillary space of plasma filtration membranes that integrate into existing kidney dialysis systems. Device therapies that evolve from this platform allow rapid extracorporeal capture and selective retention of target particles {\textless} 200 nm from the entire circulatory system. This strategy is supported by clinical experience in hepatitis C virus-infected patients using an {ADAPT}™ device, the Hemopurifier®, to reduce the systemic load of virions having similar sizes and glycosylated surfaces as cancer exosomes. This review discusses the possible therapeutic approaches for targeting immune suppressive exosomes in cancer patients, and the anticipated significance of these strategies for reversing immune dysfunction and improving responses to standard of care treatments.},

{METHODS}: Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of 742 {miRs} was performed using plasma-derived circulating microvesicles of 78 prostate cancer patients and 28 normal control individuals to identify differentially quantified {miRs}.
{RESULTS}: A total of 12 {miRs} were differentially quantified in prostate cancer patients compared with controls, including 9 in patients without metastases. In all, 11 {miRs} were present in significantly greater amounts in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with those without metastases. The association of {miR}-141 and {miR}-375 with metastatic prostate cancer was confirmed using serum-derived exosomes and microvesicles in a separate cohort of patients with recurrent or non-recurrent disease following radical prostatectomy. An analysis of five selected {miRs} in urine samples found that {miR}-107 and {miR}-574-3p were quantified at significantly higher concentrations in the urine of men with prostate cancer compared with controls.
{CONCLUSION}: These observations suggest that changes in {miR} concentration in prostate cancer patients may be identified by analysing various body fluids. Moreover, circulating {miRs} may be used to diagnose and stage prostate cancer.},

The process of metastasis is highly selective, and the metastatic lesion represents the end point of many destructive events that only a few cells can survive. Neoplasms, which are predominantly heterogeneous, contain a variety of subpopulations of cells with differing metastatic potential. Furthermore, metastatic cell variants have been shown to preexist in murine neoplasms of old and recent origin. The possible existence of highly metastatic variant cells within a primary tumor suggests that we no longer should consider a neoplasm to be a uniform entity. Efforts to design effective therapeutic agents and procedures against malignant tumors should be directed toward the few but fatal metastatic subpopulations of cells.},

We describe large-scale single-base resolution {DNA} methylation profiling on a diverse collection of 82 human cell lines and tissues using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing ({RRBS}). Analysis integrating {RNA}-seq and {ChIP}-seq data illuminates the functional role of this dynamic mark. Loci that are hypermethylated across cancer types are enriched for sites bound by {NANOG} in embryonic stem cells, which supports and expands the model of a stem/progenitor cell signature in cancer. {CpGs} that are hypomethylated across cancer types are concentrated in megabase-scale domains that occur near the telomeres and centromeres of chromosomes, are depleted of genes, and are enriched for cancer-specific {EZH}2 binding and H3K27me3 (repressive chromatin). In noncancer samples, there are cell-type specific methylation signatures preserved in primary cell lines and tissues as well as methylation differences induced by cell culture. The relationship between methylation and expression is context-dependent, and we find that {CpG}-rich enhancers bound by {EP}300 in the bodies of expressed genes are unmethylated despite the dense gene-body methylation surrounding them. Non-{CpG} cytosine methylation occurs in human somatic tissue, is particularly prevalent in brain tissue, and is reproducible across many individuals. This study provides an atlas of {DNA} methylation across diverse and well-characterized samples and enables new discoveries about {DNA} methylation and its role in gene regulation and disease.},

	volume = {14},

	doi = {10.1186/bcr3215},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Macrophages comprise an essential component of the mammary microenvironment necessary for normal gland development. However, there is no viable in vivo model to study their role in normal human breast function. We hypothesized that adding primary human macrophages to the murine mammary gland would enhance and provide a novel approach to examine immune-stromal cell interactions during the humanization process.
{METHODS}: Primary human macrophages, in the presence or absence of ectopic estrogen stimulation, were used to humanize mouse mammary glands. Mechanisms of enhanced humanization were identified by cytokine/chemokine {ELISAs}, zymography, western analysis, invasion and proliferation assays; results were confirmed with immunohistological analysis.
{RESULTS}: The combined treatment of macrophages and estrogen stimulation significantly enhanced the percentage of the total gland humanized and the engraftment/outgrowth success rate. Timecourse analysis revealed the disappearance of the human macrophages by two weeks post-injection, suggesting that the improved overall growth and invasiveness of the fibroblasts provided a larger stromal bed for epithelial cell proliferation and structure formation. Confirming their promotion of fibroblasts humanization, estrogen-stimulated macrophages significantly enhanced fibroblast proliferation and invasion in vitro, as well as significantly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen ({PCNA}) positive cells in humanized glands. Cytokine/chemokine {ELISAs}, zymography and western analyses identified {TNFα} and {MMP}9 as potential mechanisms by which estrogen-stimulated macrophages enhanced humanization. Specific inhibitors to {TNFα} and {MMP}9 validated the effects of these molecules on fibroblast behavior in vitro, as well as by immunohistochemical analysis of humanized glands for human-specific {MMP}9 expression. Lastly, glands humanized with macrophages had enhanced engraftment and tumor growth compared to glands humanized with fibroblasts alone.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Herein, we demonstrate intricate immune and stromal cell paracrine interactions in a humanized in vivo model system. We confirmed our in vivo results with in vitro analyses, highlighting the value of this model to interchangeably substantiate in vitro and in vivo results. It is critical to understand the signaling networks that drive paracrine cell interactions, for tumor cells exploit these signaling mechanisms to support their growth and invasive properties. This report presents a dynamic in vivo model to study primary human immune/fibroblast/epithelial interactions and to advance our knowledge of the stromal-derived signals that promote tumorigenesis.},

Metastasis formation in the bone is a complex process that requires cooperative reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and the cellular environment of the bone, which includes osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

Results: Seven hundred sixty-seven tumors (6.2\%) were classified as {ILC}, 8,607 (70.5\%) were classified as {IDC}, and 2,832 (23.2\%) were classified as other. The analysis is limited to the 9,374 patients categorized as either pure {IDC} or {ILC}. The median follow-up time was 13 years. Compared with {IDC}, {ILC} was associated with older age; larger, better differentiated, and estrogen receptor ({ER})-positive tumors; and less vessel invasion. Mastectomy was used more frequently for {ILC} (P {\textless} .01). There was a significant (P {\textless} .01) early advantage in disease-free survival and overall survival for the {ILC} cohort followed by a significant (P {\textless} .01) late advantage for the {IDC} cohort after 6 and 10 years, respectively. Similar patterns were observed in cohorts defined by {ER} status. {ILC} was associated with an increased incidence of bone events but a decrease in regional and lung events (all P {\textless} .01). {CONCLUSION}: {ILC} is more than a histologic variant of breast cancer.

Owing to poorly annotated and incomplete pathway data, researchers have begun to combine pathway and gene-set enrichment analysis as well as network module-based approaches to identify crucial relationships between different molecular mechanisms.
{METHODS}: To meet the new challenge of molecular phenotype discovery, in this work, we have developed an integrated online database, the Pathway And Gene Enrichment Database ({PAGED}), to enable comprehensive searches for disease-specific pathways, gene signatures, {microRNA} targets, and network modules by integrating gene-set-based prior knowledge as molecular patterns from multiple levels: the genome, transcriptome, post-transcriptome, and proteome.
{RESULTS}: The online database we developed, {PAGED} http://bio.informatics.iupui.edu/{PAGED} is by far the most comprehensive public compilation of gene sets. In its current release, {PAGED} contains a total of 25,242 gene sets, 61,413 genes, 20 organisms, and 1,275,560 records from five major categories. Beyond its size, the advantage of {PAGED} lies in the explorations of relationships between gene sets as gene-set association networks ({GSANs}). Using colorectal cancer expression data analysis as a case study, we demonstrate how to query this database resource to discover crucial pathways, gene signatures, and gene network modules specific to colorectal cancer functional genomics.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This integrated online database lays a foundation for developing tools beyond third-generation pathway analysis approaches on for discovering molecular phenotypes, especially for disease-associated pathway/gene-set enrichment analysis.},

We illustrate this {HOSVD} with an integration of genome-scale {mRNA} expression data from three yeast cell cycle time courses, two of which are under exposure to either hydrogen peroxide or menadione. We find that significant subtensors represent independent biological programs or experimental phenomena. The picture that emerges suggests that the conserved genes {YKU}70, {MRE}11, {AIF}1, and {ZWF}1, and the processes of retrotransposition, apoptosis, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that these genes are involved in, may play significant, yet previously unrecognized, roles in the differential effects of hydrogen peroxide and menadione on cell cycle progression.

	abstract = {The majority of tumors arising in {BRCA}1 mutation carriers exhibit inactivation of p53, a key effector of cell death after {DNA} damage. Despite the loss of p53, {BRCA}1-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cisplatin, and patients with {BRCA}1-associated ovarian carcinomas experience improved outcomes with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with sporadic cases. Although it is known that chemosensitivity in {BRCA}1-associated cancers is associated with unrepaired {DNA} damage, the specific effector pathway mediating the cellular response to platinum-induced damage in these tumors is poorly understood. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73, encoding a proapoptotic protein that is linked to chemosensitivity in many settings, is upregulated through a novel epigenetic mechanism in both human and murine models of {BRCA}1-associated ovarian carcinoma. {BRCA}1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor {ZEB}1, leading to the abrogation of {ZEB}1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms ({TAp}73). Cisplatin chemotherapy induces {TAp}73 target genes specifically in {BRCA}1-deficient cells, and knockdown of {TAp}73 in these cells causes chemoresistance while having little or no effect on {BRCA}1-expressing tumor cells. In primary ovarian carcinomas, {ZEB}1 binding site methylation and {TAp}73 expression correlate with {BRCA}1 status and with clinical response. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism that supports the contribution of {TAp}73 as an important mediator of the response to platinum chemotherapy in a subset of ovarian carcinomas. {TAp}73 might represent a response predictor and potential therapeutic target for enhancing chemosensitivity in this disease.},

	volume = {9},
	issn = {1479-5876},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22123319},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, has demonstrated an improvement in overall survival in two phase {III} trials of patients with advanced melanoma. The primary objective of the current trial was to prospectively explore candidate biomarkers from the tumor microenvironment for associations with clinical response to ipilimumab.


{METHODS}

In this randomized, double-blind, phase {II} biomarker study ({ClinicalTrials}.gov {NCT}00261365), 82 pretreated or treatment-naïve patients with unresectable stage {III}/{IV} melanoma were induced with 3 or 10 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 doses; at Week 24, patients could receive maintenance doses every 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated per modified World Health Organization response criteria and safety was assessed continuously. Candidate biomarkers were evaluated in tumor biopsies collected pretreatment and 24 to 72 hours after the second ipilimumab dose. Polymorphisms in immune-related genes were also evaluated.


{RESULTS}

Objective response rate, response patterns, and safety were consistent with previous trials of ipilimumab in melanoma. No associations between genetic polymorphisms and clinical activity were observed. Immunohistochemistry and histology on tumor biopsies revealed significant associations between clinical activity and high baseline expression of {FoxP}3 (p = 0.014) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (p = 0.012), and between clinical activity and increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ({TILs}) between baseline and 3 weeks after start of treatment (p = 0.005). Microarray analysis of {mRNA} from tumor samples taken pretreatment and post-treatment demonstrated significant increases in expression of several immune-related genes, and decreases in expression of genes implicated in cancer and melanoma.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Baseline expression of immune-related tumor biomarkers and a post-treatment increase in {TILs} may be positively associated with ipilimumab clinical activity. The observed pharmacodynamic changes in gene expression warrant further analysis to determine whether treatment-emergent changes in gene expression may be associated with clinical efficacy. Further studies are required to determine the predictive value of these and other potential biomarkers associated with clinical response to ipilimumab.},

	abstract = {Although individual tumors of the same clinical type have surprisingly diverse genomic alterations, these events tend to occur in a limited number of pathways, and alterations that affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient. While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer ({MEMo}). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2) member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), the method identifies the principal known altered modules in glioblastoma ({GBM}) and highlights the striking mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in the {PI}(3)K, p53, and Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel observation that inactivation of {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 is mutually exclusive of amplification of {CCNE}1 and inactivation of {RB}1, suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability in this cancer type; and, we identify {RBBP}8 as a candidate oncogene involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any cancer genomics data set, the algorithm can nominate oncogenic alterations that have a particularly strong selective effect and may also be useful in the design of therapeutic combinations in cases where mutual exclusivity reflects synthetic lethality.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women across the world. The last few decades have seen significant reduction in mortality owing to earlier detection and better adjuvant treatments that were developed based on clinical staging and morphological features. As these treatments have evolved, the heterogeneity of breast cancer poses a new challenge, since there is no standard gold-therapy suitable for all tumors of the mammary gland. Therefore, contemporary management and research efforts are directed toward specific prognostic and predictive molecular signatures that can guide targeted individualized therapy. The goal of ongoing research in this field is to identify specific molecular targets for developing novel therapeutic approaches. These targets can also serve to improve screening of breast cancer. This review focuses on the role of cancer testis antigens ({CTAs}) in breast carcinogenesis and explores the potential for development of targeted screening and therapeutic approaches. Normally found in the testes, these antigens are highly correlative with cancers of the breast, skin, and ovaries. These implications have been further corroborated through uncovering the interaction of {CTAs} with genes and proteins involved in tumor suppression and homeostasis like p53. There is some evidence that these genes can be targeted for early detection in addition to being candidates for cancer immunotherapy.},

To achieve this, we have developed an approach that superposes experimentally-based annotations onto the leaves of phylogenetic trees and then we manually annotate the function of the common ancestors, predicated on the assumption that the ancestors possessed the experimentally determined functions that are held in common at these leaves, and that these functions are likely to be conserved in all other descendents of each family.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Cancer cells in the body release soluble and membranous factors that manipulate the tumor environment to facilitate growth and survival. Recent years have provided evidence that small microvesicles that are termed exosomes may play a pivotal role in this process. Exosomes are membrane vesicles with a size of 40-100 nm that are released by both tumor and normal cells and can be found in various body fluids. Tumor-derived exosomes carry functional proteins, {mRNAs}, and {miRNAs} and could serve as novel platform for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. However, marker proteins that allow enrichment of tumor-derived exosomes over normal exosomes are less well defined.
{METHODS}: We used Western blot analysis and antibody coupled magnetic beads to characterize {CD}24 and {EpCAM} as markers for exosomes. We investigated ovarian carcinoma ascites, pleural effusions and serum of breast carcinoma patients. As non-tumor derived control we used exosomes from ascites of liver cirrhosis patients.
{RESULTS}: Exosomes could be isolated from all body fluids and contained marker proteins as well as {miRNAs}. We observed that {CD}24 and {EpCAM} were selectively present on ascites exosomes of tumor patients and copurified together on anti-{EpCAM} or anti-{CD}24 magnetic beads. In breast cancer patients {CD}24 was present but {EpCAM} was absent from serum exosomes. Instead, the intact {EpCAM} ectodomain was recovered in a soluble form. We provide evidence that {EpCAM} can be cleaved from exosomes via serum metalloproteinase(s).
{CONCLUSION}: Loss of {EpCAM} on serum exosomes may hamper enrichment by immune-affinity isolation. We suggest that {CD}24 could be an additional marker for the enrichment of tumor-derived exosomes from blood.},

The protein expression pattern of the primary tumor may influence the first distant metastasis site. {METHODS}: We identified from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry patients diagnosed with breast cancer in five geographical regions Finland in 1991-1992, reviewed the hospital case records, and collected primary tumor tissue. Out of the 2,032 cases identified, 234 developed distant metastases after a median follow-up time of 2.7 years and had the first metastatic site documented (a total of 321 sites). Primary tumor microarray ({TMA}) cores were analyzed for 17 proteins using immunohistochemistry and for {erbB}2 using chromogenic in situ hybridization, and their associations with the first metastasis site were examined. The cancers were classified into luminal A, luminal B, {HER}2+ enriched, basal-like or non-expressor subtypes. {RESULTS}: A total of 3,886 {TMA} cores were analyzed. Luminal A cancers had a propensity to give rise first to bone metastases, {HER}2-enriched cancers to liver and lung metastases, and basal type cancers to liver and brain metastases. Primary tumors that gave first rise to bone metastases expressed frequently estrogen receptor ({ER}) and {SNAI}1 ({SNAIL}) and rarely {COX}2 and {HER}2, tumors with first metastases in the liver expressed infrequently {SNAI}1, those with lung metastases expressed frequently the epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}), cytokeratin-5 ({CK}5) and {HER}2, and infrequently progesterone receptor ({PgR}), tumors with early skin metastases expressed infrequently E-cadherin, and breast tumors with first metastases in the brain expressed nestin, prominin-1 and {CK}5 and infrequently {ER} and {PgR}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Breast tumor biological subtypes have a tendency to give rise to first distant metastases at certain body sites.

Finding the canonical correlations between these datasets requires the inversion of their corresponding sample correlation matrices. When the number of variables is large compared to the number of experimental units it is impossible to calculate the inverse of these matrices directly and therefore it is necessary to add a multiple of the identity matrix to them. This procedure is known as regularization. In this paper we present an alternative method to the existing regularization algorithm. The proposed method is based on the estimates of the correlation matrices which minimize the mean squared error risk function. The solution of this optimization problem can be found analytically and consists of a small set of computationally inexpensive equations. We also present material which shows that the proposed method is more stable and provides more accurate results than the standard regularized canonical correlation method. Finally, the application of our original method to {NCI}-60 {microRNA} cancer data proves that it can deliver useful insights in study cases which involve hundreds of variables.},

Nevertheless, a growing number of {HERV} genes and proteins have been found to be expressed in different cancers, raising the possibility that {HERV}-derived antigens might represent excellent targets for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we review data showing {HERV}-encoded antigens are capable of eliciting humoral and T-cells specific antitumor immunity. We also describe a novel {HERV}-E that was recently found to be selectively expressed in over 80\% of clear cell kidney cancer but not in normal tissues. Remarkably, the restricted expression of {HERV}-E in kidney tumors was found to occur as a consequence of inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. Importantly, antigens derived from this provirus are immunogenic, stimulating cytotoxic T-cells that kill kidney cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken altogether, these data suggest efforts aimed at boosting human immunity against {HERV}-derived antigens could be used as a strategy to treat advanced tumors including kidney cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Public data integration may help overcome challenges in clinical implementation of microarray profiles. We integrated several ovarian cancer datasets to identify a reproducible predictor of survival.
{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: Four microarray datasets from different institutions comprising 265 advanced stage tumors were uniformly reprocessed into a single training dataset, also adjusting for inter-laboratory variation ("batch-effect"). Supervised principal component survival analysis was employed to identify prognostic models. Models were independently validated in a 61-patient cohort using a custom array genechip and a publicly available 229-array dataset. Molecular correspondence of high- and low-risk outcome groups between training and validation datasets was demonstrated using Subclass Mapping. Previously established molecular phenotypes in the 2(nd) validation set were correlated with high and low-risk outcome groups. Functional representational and pathway analysis was used to explore gene networks associated with high and low risk phenotypes. A 19-gene model showed optimal performance in the training set (median {OS} 31 and 78 months, p {\textless} 0.01), 1(st) validation set (median {OS} 32 months versus not-yet-reached, p = 0.026) and 2(nd) validation set (median {OS} 43 versus 61 months, p = 0.013) maintaining independent prognostic power in multivariate analysis. There was strong molecular correspondence of the respective high- and low-risk tumors between training and 1(st) validation set. Low and high-risk tumors were enriched for favorable and unfavorable molecular subtypes and pathways, previously defined in the public 2(nd) validation set.
{CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: Integration of previously generated cancer microarray datasets may lead to robust and widely applicable survival predictors. These predictors are not simply a compilation of prognostic genes but appear to track true molecular phenotypes of good- and poor-outcome.},

	volume = {11},
	issn = {1471-2407},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21989116},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma ({OSCC}) is a major cause of cancer death worldwide, which is mainly due to recurrence leading to treatment failure and patient death. Histological status of surgical margins is a currently available assessment for recurrence risk in {OSCC}; however histological status does not predict recurrence, even in patients with histologically negative margins. Therefore, molecular analysis of histologically normal resection margins and the corresponding {OSCC} may aid in identifying a gene signature predictive of recurrence.


{METHODS}

We used a meta-analysis of 199 samples ({OSCCs} and normal oral tissues) from five public microarray datasets, in addition to our microarray analysis of 96 {OSCCs} and histologically normal margins from 24 patients, to train a gene signature for recurrence. Validation was performed by quantitative real-time {PCR} using 136 samples from an independent cohort of 30 patients.


{RESULTS}

We identified 138 significantly over-expressed genes ({\textgreater} 2-fold, false discovery rate of 0.01) in {OSCC}. By penalized likelihood Cox regression, we identified a 4-gene signature with prognostic value for recurrence in our training set. This signature comprised the invasion-related genes {MMP}1, {COL}4A1, P4HA2, and {THBS}2. Over-expression of this 4-gene signature in histologically normal margins was associated with recurrence in our training cohort (p = 0.0003, logrank test) and in our independent validation cohort (p = 0.04, {HR} = 6.8, logrank test).


{CONCLUSION}

Gene expression alterations occur in histologically normal margins in {OSCC}. Over-expression of the 4-gene signature in histologically normal surgical margins was validated and highly predictive of recurrence in an independent patient cohort. Our findings may be applied to develop a molecular test, which would be clinically useful to help predict which patients are at a higher risk of local recurrence.},

Transformed {BPECs} gave rise to lung metastases and were up to 10(4)-fold more tumorigenic than transformed {HMECs}, which are nonmetastatic.

	abstract = {Biomarkers are of tremendous importance for the prediction, diagnosis, and observation of the therapeutic success of common complex multifactorial metabolic diseases, such as type {II} diabetes and obesity. However, the predictive power of the traditional biomarkers used (eg, plasma metabolites and cytokines, body parameters) is apparently not sufficient for reliable monitoring of stage-dependent pathogenesis starting with the healthy state via its initiation and development to the established disease and further progression to late clinical outcomes. Moreover, the elucidation of putative considerable differences in the underlying pathogenetic pathways (eg, related to cellular/tissue origin, epigenetic and environmental effects) within the patient population and, consequently, the differentiation between individual options for disease prevention and therapy - hallmarks of personalized medicine - plays only a minor role in the traditional biomarker concept of metabolic diseases. In contrast, multidimensional and interdependent patterns of genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic markers presumably will add a novel quality to predictive values, provided they can be followed routinely along the complete individual disease pathway with sufficient precision. These requirements may be fulfilled by small membrane vesicles, which are so-called exosomes and microvesicles ({EMVs}) that are released via two distinct molecular mechanisms from a wide variety of tissue and blood cells into the circulation in response to normal and stress/pathogenic conditions and are equipped with a multitude of transmembrane, soluble and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, {mRNAs}, and {microRNAs}. Based on the currently available data, {EMVs} seem to reflect the diverse functional and dysfunctional states of the releasing cells and tissues along the complete individual pathogenetic pathways underlying metabolic diseases. A critical step in further validation of {EMVs} as biomarkers will rely on the identification of unequivocal correlations between critical disease states and specific {EMV} signatures, which in future may be determined in rapid and convenient fashion using nanoparticle-driven biosensors.},

A total of 103 tastings were recorded (42 in Ireland, 61 elsewhere) in 71 different pubs spread over 33 cities and 14 countries. The enjoyment of Guinness consumed in Ireland was rated higher (74 mm {VAS}) than outside Ireland (57 mm; P {\textless} 0.001). This difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for researcher, pub ambience, Guinness appearance, and the sensory measures mouthfeel, flavor, and aftertaste. This study is the first to provide scientific evidence that Guinness does not travel well and that the enjoyment of Guinness (for our group of nonexpert tasters) was higher when in Ireland. Results, however, are subject to further verification because of limitations in the study design.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cell migration is an essential process in organ homeostasis, in inflammation, and also in metastasis, the main cause of death from cancer. The extracellular matrix ({ECM}) serves as the molecular scaffold for cell adhesion and migration; in the first phase of migration, adhesion of cells to the {ECM} is critical. Engagement of integrin receptors with {ECM} ligands gives rise to the formation of complex multiprotein structures which link the {ECM} to the cytoplasmic actin skeleton. Both {ECM} proteins and the adhesion receptors are glycoproteins, and it is well accepted that N-glycans modulate their conformation and activity, thereby affecting cell-{ECM} interactions. Likely targets for glycosylation are the integrins, whose ability to form functional dimers depends upon the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides. Cell migratory behavior may depend on the level of expression of adhesion proteins, and their N-glycosylation that affect receptor-ligand binding. {SCOPE} {OF} {REVIEW}: The mechanism underlying the effect of integrin glycosylation on migration is still unknown, but results gained from integrins with artificial or mutated N-glycosylation sites provide evidence that integrin function can be regulated by changes in glycosylation. {GENERAL} {SIGNIFICANCE}: A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of cell migration processes could lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and applications.

	abstract = {Purpose Recent studies suggest that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ({TILs}) are associated with disease-free ({DFS}) and overall survival ({OS}) in operable triple-negative breast cancer ({TNBC}). We seek to validate the prognostic impact of {TILs} in primary {TNBCs} in two adjuvant phase {III} trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ({ECOG}).
Patients and Methods Full-face hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections of 506 tumors from {ECOG} trials E2197 and E1199 were evaluated for density of {TILs} in intraepithelial ({iTILs}) and stromal compartments ({sTILs}). Patient cases of {TNBC} from E2197 and E1199 were randomly selected based on availability of sections. For the primary end point of {DFS}, association with {TIL} scores was determined by fitting proportional hazards models stratified on study. Secondary end points were {OS} and distant recurrence–free interval ({DRFI}). Reporting recommendations for tumor marker prognostic studies criteria were followed, and all analyses were prespecified.
Results The majority of 481 evaluable cancers had {TILs} ({sTILs}, 80\%; {iTILs}, 15\%). With a median follow-up of 10.6 years, higher {sTIL} scores were associated with better prognosis; for every 10\% increase in {sTILs}, a 14\% reduction of risk of recurrence or death (P = .02), 18\% reduction of risk of distant recurrence (P = .04), and 19\% reduction of risk of death (P = .01) were observed. Multivariable analysis confirmed {sTILs} to be an independent prognostic marker of {DFS}, {DRFI}, and {OS}.
Conclusion In two national randomized clinical trials using contemporary adjuvant chemotherapy, we confirm that stromal lymphocytic infiltration constitutes a robust prognostic factor in {TNBCs}. Studies assessing outcomes and therapeutic efficacies should consider stratification for this parameter.},

	abstract = {Gene expression of all known subtypes of oestrogen receptor ({ER}) and oestrogen-related receptor ({ERR}) in multiple organs and both sexes of the Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes was profiled and systematically analysed. As revealed by statistical analyses and low-dimensional projections, the expressions of {ERRs} proved to be organ and sex dependent, which is in contrast with the ubiquitous nature of {ERs}. Moreover, expressions of specific {ERR} isoforms ({ERRγ}1, {ERRγ}2) were strongly correlated with that of all {ERs} ({ERα}, {ERβ}1 and {ERβ}2), suggesting the existence of potential interactions. Findings of this study shed light on the co-regulatory role of particular {ERRs} in oestrogen-{ERs} signalling and highlight the potential importance of {ERRs} in determining organ and sex-specific oestrogen responses. Using O. latipes as an alternative vertebrate model, this study provides new directions that call for collective efforts from the scientific community to unravel the mechanistic action of {ER}-{ERR} cross-talks, and their intertwining functions, in a cell and sex-specific manner in vivo.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that thousands of genes may contribute to breast cancer pathophysiologies when deregulated by genomic or epigenomic events. Here, we describe a model "system" to appraise the functional contributions of these genes to breast cancer subsets. In general, the recurrent genomic and transcriptional characteristics of 51 breast cancer cell lines mirror those of 145 primary breast tumors, although some significant differences are documented. The cell lines that comprise the system also exhibit the substantial genomic, transcriptional, and biological heterogeneity found in primary tumors. We show, using Trastuzumab (Herceptin) monotherapy as an example, that the system can be used to identify molecular features that predict or indicate response to targeted therapies or other physiological perturbations.},

	volume = {177},
	issn = {1938-5404},
	abstract = {Communication between irradiated and un-irradiated (bystander) cells can cause damage in cells that are not directly targeted by ionizing radiation, a process known as the bystander effect. Bystander effects can also lead to chromosomal/genomic instability within the progeny of bystander cells, similar to the progeny of directly irradiated cells. The factors that mediate this cellular communication can be transferred between cells via gap junctions or released into the extracellular media following irradiation, but their nature has not been fully characterized. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the bystander effect mediator contains an {RNA} molecule that may be carried by exosomes. {MCF}7 cells were irradiated with 2 Gy of X rays and the extracellular media was harvested. {RNase} treatment abrogated the ability of the media to induce early and late chromosomal damage in bystander cells. Furthermore, treatment of bystander cells with exosomes isolated from this media increased the levels of genomic damage. These results suggest that the bystander effect, and genomic instability, are at least in part mediated by exosomes and implicate a role for {RNA}.},
